# Through the Gaze

**The cinema industry is now becoming more open and accepting of different identities which have always been suffocated by male-centered perspectives. But to what extent do popular U.S. films rely on the male gaze?**

The project was developed for the final exam of the course "Information Visualization" (a.y. 2022/2023) held by Prof. Marilena Daquino @ Alma Mater Studiorum - University of Bologna, MA "DHDK".

Sunrise. Under the early morning light appears City of 
Rome. 

NARRATOR 

This is Rome. The eternal city. The 
sixty-third year of the modern era. 

Camera begins slowly panning to the right, showing a 
panoramic view and the outline of Rome's buildings, 
meanwhile the progress of the time of a day is shown through 
the changes of the light. 

NARRATOR 

Thirty years ago, far to the East 
of the Roman Empire, in the land of 
Judea, Jesus Christ was crucified. 

The natural soft morning light transforms into the 
afternoon. The camera reaches the central point of the Arena 
- The Egyptian Obelisk. A white pigeon sits on top of the 
obelisk. 

NARRATOR 
The Passion on the Cross was not 
the end, but the beginning of a new 
life. 

FADE OUT 



SCENE 5 DAY_EXT_APPIAN ROAD. EARLY EVENING 

FADE IN 

Appian Road is empty at this time of a day. There is only a 
long shadow of PETER THE APOSTLE, who looks ahead at the 
hilly surrounding area. Beneath his hood you can see his 
grave expression and tired face. 

The sun begins to appear from over the hillsides. Peter 
shields his eyes with his hand, trying to see the white 
pigeon, which flapped its wings loudly. 

Peter sinks to his knees, resting his hands and head on his 
staff. Around his outline appears a pulsing, golden light . 

Than the single beam of light splits like a prism into two 
streaks — one of them is pale pink — another clear, 
luminous . 



2. 



The staff slides from under him and he falls face down in 
the Sand, his head still covered by his hood. Peter 
stretches his hands forward as if reaching for someone' s 
feet. 

Silence falls. The golden light fades. Peter raises his head 
slightly . 

PETER 
Quo Vadis, Domine?

SCENE 7 DAY_INT_PETRONIUS PALACE_ATRIUM 
The interior of PETRONIUS'S home. 

Petronius stands in his atrium close to a pool filled with 
fresh water. There is a statue of Petronius behind him. Both 
he and his statue stand motionless . Petronius observes the 
golden haired EUNICE, who is straightening the folds in her 
tunic. 

MARK VINICIUS enters the atrium with the springy step of a 
soldier. 

VINCICIUS 
Greetings Petronius! May the Gods 
bring you prosperity! 

PETRONIUS 
By Jupiter! My nephew Marcus 
Vinicius ! A true god of war. Dear 
me, let me embrace you! 

Petronius makes a sudden movement towards Marcus Vinicius, 
unknowingly almost knocking Eunice over. 

Petronius hugs Vinicius. 

PETRONIUS 
Welcome back to Rome! You return 
from the war in Armenia? 



Vinicius takes a step back and turns sideways to Petronius. 



3. 



VINICIUS 

Yes and a sorry business it is, a 
totally unnecessary war! 

He retreats further into the chamber. Petronius follows him 
and puts a hand on his shoulder. Vinicius turns his head. 

PETRONIUS 
A true soldier turns away from war 
only when love has him enslaved. Do 
I guess correctly? 

Vinicius remains silent . 

PETRONIUS 
Has Cupid's arrow pierced your 
heart ? 

Vinicius face glows with radiance. 

VINICIUS 

What a perceptive judge of people 
you are, Petronius! No wonder 
you're Ceaser' s chief counselor. 

PETRONIUS 
To advise Nero, it's sufficient to 
know the ways of monkeys. What am I 
saying! Even monkeys are not so 
stupid as to believe everything 
they're told. 

VINICIUS 

Is it that bad at the Palatine? War 
lets you forget about those things. 

PETRONIUS 
War even allows one to believe that 
there's a method to all this 
madness. But Rome will soon cure 
you of any such illusions. Unless, 
you've been enchanted by 
somemermaid. Speak up, boy! 

Vinicius grabs his arm and begins to speak rapidly. 

VINICIUS 
Returning from the battle, I 
stopped at the house of Aulus 
Plautius . He made me most welcome, 
and that was where I saw her. One 
day, at dawn, I caught sight of her 
at the fountain. The morning rays

VINICIUS (CD) 
seemed to pass right through her 
body. 

Vinicius' face beams. Petronius laughs. 

PETRONIUS 
As transparent as a young sardine! 
So you truly have fallen in love 
with a mermaid!

FLASHBACK. Slow motion. LIGIA is seen from behind standing 
next to a fountain and dipping her hand in the cool water. 
She turns to the camera and smiles with girlish innocence. 
END OF SLOW MOTION 

Vinicius stands admiring Ligia. He is at first struck dumb 
by her beauty. 

VINICIUS 

Are you Venus? [Pause] Because only 
a goddess could look like that . 

Ligia stares at Vinicius, but makes no reply. A girlish 
smile full of curiosity spreads across her face. 

VINICIUS 
Allow me . . . 

Vinicius stutters like a nervous schoolboy. 

VINICIUS (CD) 

. . . to . . . 

Ligia bends down and with her finger draws the "Pisces" 
symbol in the sand. Vinicius suddenly crouches beside her 
and when he tries to take her by the hand, but Ligia '^s hand 
gives him the slip. 

VINICIUS (OFF) 
They call her Lygia, but her name 
is Callina. She makes. . . this 
hunger burn inside me. She must be 
mine.

SCENE 8A DAY_INT_PETRONIUS PALACE - ATRIUM 
BACK TO REALITY 

Petronius watches with amusement as Vinicius nervously paces 
up and down the terrarium alongside the pool. 

PETRONIUS 
The maiden or the fish? 

VINICIUS 

Both. 

In the meantime, several beautiful slave girls enter - two 
Ethiopians, three slender Greeks and Eunice. 

PETRONIUS 
Better fish than these you see here 
are not to be found in all of Rome. 
Eunice! 

An intimidated Eunice walks up to them. 

PETRONIUS 
What do you think of Eunice? She 
smells of violets. Even I do not 
know how sweet her kisses taste. 
Take her. 

Eunice throws herself at Petronius feet, pleading. 

EUNICE 

Please, Master, don't send me away. 

Petronius is visibly upset by her disobedience. 

Vinicius turns down the offer by shaking his head and 
turning his back to them as an Ethiopian slave presents a 
bowl of oils for Petronius to rinse his hands. 

VINICIUS 

I want only Lygia. She is worth a 
hundred of these. She is the 
daughter of kings. 

Petronius wipes his brow, wraps his arm around Vinicius' s 
shoulder and leads him towards the exit. 

PETRONIUS 
You mentioned hunger? Let's go for 
breakfast. That will refresh the 
body, and then we'll do something 
for the soul . What do you think of 

(CD) 



6. 



PETRONIUS (CD) 
the Plautiuses? What do you say we 
pay them a visit? 

After they exit, the slaves pick up all the baskets and 
bowls and leave. 

Eunice looks around and when she sees no one is looking she 
runs up to the statue of Petronius , stands on her toes and 
lightly kisses him on the lips. 



SCENE 9 DAY_INT_PLAUTIUS PALACE_COLLONADE 

House of Aulus Plautius. Interior decorations in the atrium 
leading to the garden. 

Petronius and Vinicius stand opposite their hosts, POMPONIA 
and AULUS PLAUTIUS. Beyond, in the courtyard, can be seen a 
wonderful fountain . The pearls of water shine and reflect 
the sun with a rainbow. 

Petronius bows his head towards the hosts. 

PETRONIUS 
I thank you for the hospitality you 
gave my sister's son. 

AULUS PLAUTIUS 
As you well know, Petronius, I spent 
half my life on the battlefield. 
Seeing Marcus reminded me of my 
younger years. Today, as we grow 
older, our whole world lies within 
these walls. 

PETRONIUS 
In my soul I think how different 
your world is from that over which 
our Nero reigns. 

Suddenly he turns his head at the sound of joyful laughter 
from a girl and child. 

Running up from the atrium is Lygia and little AULUS. The 
boy stumbles and falls at the feet of Petronius. 

Petronius and Lygia both lean down to pick up the child. 
Their eyes meet and lock momentarily. 

The little boy gets up on his own and runs out of the room. 
Lygia runs after him. 

Pomponia replies to Petronius with a wise, gentle smile. 



7. 



POMPONIA 
It's not Nero, but God who rules 
the world. 

Petronius turns towards Vinicius. Vinicius is standing as 
still as a statue, staring at the place where Lygia left the 
room. 

PETRONIUS 
There are many gods, everyone has 
his own . 

Pomponia responds with conviction. 

POMPONIA 
There is only one God - just and 
omnipotent 

FADE OUT 



SCENE 10 AFTERNOON_EXT_ROME_STREET VIEW_FORUM ROMANUM 

FADE IN 

Lightning. The contours of the street slowly emerge. 
Petronius and Vinicius are being carried in a litter. 
Beneath them the heads of noble pedestrians flash by. 

The litter, held up by runners, turns sharply through the 
crowd and its passengers almost fall out. 

PETRONIUS (OFF) 
And so you are writing poems? 
That's quite the fashion these 
days. But you must be careful - 
Redbeard can't abide competition. 
So you'd better be writing bad 
poems or none at all. 

Petronius smiles sadly. Vinicius 's expression does not 
change, then he suddenly explodes. 

VINICIUS 

I don't care about Caesar, nor do I 
care about poetry! 

Petronius shakes his head impatiently. 



PETRONIUS 
I do believe you really are in 
love. 



8. 



Vinicius is uncomfortable in the litter. He bangs on the 
side and the runners come to a halt. Vinicius jumps out into 
the street among the crowd. 

VINICIUS 

And you, were you never in love? 

He yells at Petronius. Petronius gives him a manuscript as 
he leaves. 

VINICIUS 
What's this? 

PETRONIUS 
Poems. The author: Redbeard. 
Required reading. 

"Nero Augustus Ceasar" is written on the parchment. 

Vinicius shakes his head and moves away disappearing into 
the crowd. Petronius taps with his cane for the runners to 
continue . 

PETRONIUS 
To the Palatine Hill, Ceasar' s 
palace ! 

The litter hastily moves away. 



SCENE 11 DAY_INT_PLAUTIUS PALACE_ATRIUM 

The house of Aulus Plautius . The CENTURION HASTO enters with 
several PRAETORIAN GUARDS. The host stands in front of the 
group of soldiers. The centurion bows his head slightly. 

HASTO 

Commander! I bring you greetings 
from Caesar! 

Plautius frowns. 

AULUS PLAUTIUS 
Speak up Hasto! What is the charge? 

The centurion takes a step forward. 

HASTO 

No charges against you, sir, but an 
order from Caesar: the Divine Nero 
is grateful to you for giving 
shelter to the daughter of the 
barbarian king. But as a hostage, 
(CD) 



9. 



HASTO (CD) 
the girl belongs to Caesar. 
Therefore our divine emperor 
commands you to hand her over. 

Plautius turns around and looks at his wife, to whom Lygia 
is clinging. Next to the women stands the powerfully built 
URSUS. 



SCENE 12 DAY_INT_PLAUTIUS PALACE_ATRIUM 

Tears stream down the cheeks of Lygia and Pomponia. Plautius 
says with a voice that trembles. 

AULUS PLAUTIUS 
Lygia! Both Pomponia and I love you 
like a daughter, but you are 
Caesar's responsibility . . . 

Aulus walks past the women and disappears into the house. 
Ursus kneels before Pomponia. 

URSUS 

Domina! Allow me to go with my lady 
to the house of Caesar. 

She wipes away her tears. 

POMPONIA 
You are not mine, but Lygia' s 
servant, Ursus! Guard her closely! 

Little Aulus runs into the room and clings to Lygia' s leg, 
crying as Pomponia makes the sign of the cross on her 
forehead. 

POMPONIA 
May the Lord watch over you, 
daughter. Trust the God and believe 
that his mercy endures for ever. 



SCENE 13 LATE AFTERNOON_EXT_PETRONIUS PALACE_COLLONADE + 
INT_PETRONIUS PALACE_PATIO 

Plautius steps out of his litter and heads into the home of 
Petronius . 

On a shaded patio, Vinicius trains with his sword. He stops 
training at the sight of Plautius. 

Aulus Plautius and Vinicius stand opposite each other. The 
commander' s face is drawn in anger. 



10. 



AULUS PLAUTIUS 
I curse the moment you and 
Petronius crossed the threshold of 
our house! 

VINICIUS 

Plautius! What are you saying? Why, 
I am the most faithful of all your 
friends ! 

AULUS PLAUTIUS 
You are a thief! You have stolen my 
daughter ! 

Vinicius rushes across to Plautius. 

VINICIUS 
Speak up, tell me what has 
happened! Where is Lygia? 

Plautius halts Vinicius with a look, before he can get too 
worked up. 

AULUS PLAUTIUS 
Your uncle, Petronius persuaded 
Caesar to take Lygia to the 
Palatine, to his palace. 



SCENE 14 NIGHT_EXT_ PALATINO_ PALACE ENTRANCE 

The grounds around Caesar ' s palace - Palatine . Twilight. The 
growing buzz of laughter and cheers can be heard. The 
outlines of columns and rows of statues of gods can be seen. 
Along them move crowds of people heading towards Caesar' s 
feast . 

It gets darker; all that can be seen are the outlines of 
human figures moving in different directions. Somewhere far 
away music is playing. The light comes from lamps and 
lanterns, along with torches burning in the gardens. 

Two female figures are seen passing down a walkway bordered 
by perfectly trimmed hedges. They are illuminated by lamps 
burning on the ground behind them. The camera follows behind 
them, eventually catching up. 

One of the women is Lygia. She walks nervously, looking 
around anxiously. She is dressed in a beautiful gold tunic 
and a unique hair style. She seems a changed person as she 
holds on tightly to the arm of the other woman, ACTE. Her 
companion is older but also beautiful and speaks with a 
warm, soothing voice. 



11. 



ACTE 

You would Incur the wrath of Caesar 
by not attending his banquet. He 
wants to see you! Fear not, Lygia. 
I'll be right there with you. 

LYGIA 

You have been at Nero's side. . . As 
a wife. But I'm so terribly afraid 
of him. 

ACTE 

That is why I promised Pomponia not 
to let you out of my sight . Calm 
yourself Lygia, Caesar will soon 
forget about you, and his Poppea 
will never allow him to come close 
to you! 

Lygia smile's awkwardly as they disappear into the crowd of 
guests walking up the stairs. 



SCENE 15 NIGHT_EXT_ PALATINO_ PALACE ENTRANCE 

Two male figures move along a walkway surrounded by 
illuminated sculptures. They enter into the circle of light, 
allowing them to be recognized. It is Petronius and Marcus 
Vinicius . 

Marcus's face is clouded with emotion. Petronius repeatedly 
glances at his companion and says with sarcasm. 

PETRONIUS 
Cease this silence and grim 
expression, or they will think that 
you are hiding a dagger somewhere 
in the folds of your robes! 

VINICIUS 
This is not what I wanted, 
Petronius ! 

Petronius places his finger over his lips and laughs. 

PETRONIUS 
You know too little of the ways of 
this world, Marcus. The war has 
made a savage of you. This is Rome. 
The centre of the world. Here we 
handle matters discretely. 



12. 



VINICIUS 

Lygia should not have been abducted 
from the house of the Plautiuses. 

Petronius responds strongly. 

PETRONIUS 
Only the emperor could have taken 
her away, to then give her to you. 
You will be able to spend this 
night in her arms. 

Vinicius is stopped in his tracks, surprised. 



SCENE 16 NIGHT_INT_ NERO PALACE_ LARGE BANQUETTE HALL 

Large hall. Palatine - Caesar's Palace. A lot of guests at 
tables in a brightly lit room. Candles flicker on the tables 
and walls but the guests at the tables sit gloomily in 
silence. Acte comes in with Lygia. 



SCENE 17 NIGHT_INT_ NERO PALACE_ LARGE BANQUETTE HALL 

The buzz and hum of the banquet . Servants bring in great 
plates of food. Acte and Lygia are seated behind the long 
table . 

Acte nods towards the brightly lit end of the room and its 
decorated table. Lygia looks towards the throne with 
disdain . 

At that moment the room erupts in great applause full of 
screaming and cheering. 

CROWDS 

Hail Caesar! Hail Caesar ! Hail 
Caesar! 

CEASAR NERO, surrounded by dignitaries, enters the room. 

Caesar is placed at the table next to his closest court. 
Among which are two arch— enemies fighting for influence in 
Caesar' s court - Petronius and TIGELLINUS - the commander in 
chief of the Praetorians. 

At that moment thousands of yellow rose petals fall from the 
ceiling onto the tables and guests. Lygia stares at Nero. 
Lygia whispers with fascination. 



13. 



LIGIA 
Redbeard. . . ! 



SCENE 18 NIGHT_INT_ NERO PALACE_ LARGE BANQUETTE HALL 

Nero's table. Caesar looks around the room. After a moment, 
he focuses and squints in one particular direction. 

NERO 

Is this the beauty that Vinicius 
loves so much? 

Tigellinus leans over to Caesar and whispers in his ear. 

TIGELLINUS 
A beauty she is indeed Sire, too 
beautiful for Vinicius. 

Petronius' s face contorts with anger. 

PETRONIUS 
Sire, you are more generous to 
Vinicius than if you were his own 
father. Even Tigellinus has noticed 
she is too narrow in the hips, but 
as usual he is trying to score. You 
have missed the boat, Tigellinus! 

Nero grabs his emerald monocle, puts it up to his eye and 
stares at Lygia. Both of them await Nero's verdict. Nero 
busts out laughing. 

NERO 

Yes, missed. Too narrow in the 
hips. 

Petronius releases a sigh of relief as Tigellinus sends him 
a deadly stare. 



SCENE 19 NIGHT_INT_ NERO PALACE_ LARGE BANQUETTE HALL 

VOICES 
Poppea ! Poppea ! 

Electrifying cheers run through the room. 

AUGUSTA POPPEA, the wife of Caesar approaches, majestically 
gliding across the hall dressed in robes the color of 
amethyst and wearing gorgeous jewelry and an amazing 
hairstyle resembling a giant sailing ship. 



Nero, still staring at Lygia, pays no attention to his wife 
as he turns the emerald monocle around in front of his eye 
like a prism. 

Poppea walks up to Nero and snatches the monocle out of his 
hand. She stares into his face him and jealously hisses at 
him. 

POPPEA 

You don't need this, my divine 
Nero. The greatest beauty is right 
beside you. 

Surprised, Nero turns to her with a grimace. He reaches out 
and tears a ruby from her neck and looks at her through it, 
twirling the stone in front of his eye. 

POV Nero. This stone is cut with several facets; through it 
we can see five heads of Poppea. 

NERO 

This is a woman with five heads. 
I'll get rid of at least four of 
them. Her hairdressers cost me too 
much. 

Poppea can't hide the anger on her face but duly takes her 
place next to her husband as thousands of red rose pedals 
fall from the ceiling. 

She mutters under her breath. 

POPPEA 

You better watch for your own 
head, Nero . 



SCENE 20 NIGHT_INT_ NERO PALACE_ LARGE BANQUETTE HALL 

Acte and Lygia at the table. Lygia watches Poppea with 
delight . 

LYGIA 

How beautiful she is! 

VINICIUS 
You are a hundred times more 
beautiful . 

Lygia hears the voice of Vinicius, who is standing behind 
her. 



15. 



VINICIUS 
Hail, Callina-Lygia ! 

Vinicius takes a place next to the girl, moving Acte to the 
side. He is wearing a scarlet tunic, his bare arms decorated 
in golden epaulettes. 

Vinicius reluctantly looks at Acte. He grabs Lygia by her 
hand and leans over, whispering in her ear. Lygia tries to 
pull away gently. 

VINICIUS 
I knew I'd find you here. But 
little did I know it would make me 
so happy! 

Acte begins to intervene as Vinicius pulls Lygia towards 
him, but upon hearing Nero is going to sing, she interrupts, 
wanting everyone to listen to him sing. 

ACTE 

Hold your breaths! Caesar is about 
to sing. 



SCENE 21 NIGHT_INT_ NERO PALACE_ LARGE BANQUETTE HALL 

Nero recites a poem, posing grotesquely like an actor, while 
holding his zither in his hands. 

NERON 

Sweet Venus, founder of Rome and 
pride of the Gods, You who guard 
travelers on the high seas, and 
make the land fruit full for all 
living things, the Goddess of 
sunlight who stills the storm for 
you clouds clear away. . . 

The young FREEDMAN PITAGORAS kneels at the feet of Caesar. 
He removes the laurel wreath from his head and puts it at 
the feet of Caesar with an expression of adulation on his 
face. 

CROWDLL 

Oh heavenly voice! Our divine 
Caesar! Redbeard, the greatest poet 
in the world! 

Nero looks quizzically at Petronius and then at Tigellinus, 
then again at Petronius. A boundless self -admiration appears 
on his face. 



16. 



Petronius remains in an indifferent silence, as if the 
spectacle did not make the slightest impression on him. 

Not finding delight in the eyes of Petronius, Nero changes 
his expression to that of a little boy begging for the 
praise of his father. Petronius drags out the situation but 
in the end speaks while retaining his stone face. 



PETRONIUS 
Cursed be the fate that has us live 
with such a poet . Were his verses 
any worst, perhaps I could find it 
in my heart to praise them. But I 
remain silent. Embarrassed. 
Destroyed by their beauty. 



Nero's face lights up with delight and boundless vanity. 
Nero grabs a chalice to take a drink of wine. 

Pitagoras throws himself to pour more wine for Nero as 
Tigellinus fumes in jealousy. 



TIGELLINUS 
Thy verses, Caesar, were born like 
you among the gods. Their father is 
Zeus Apollo and their mother. . . . 



Nero turns red in anger. 



NERO 

Silence Fool ! My mother was 
Agrippina, a cursed woman . . . 

A gloomy expression appears on Nero's face. 

NERO 

I had no choice; I had to sentence 
her to death, because she sent an 
assassin to murder me. If I hadn't 
acted quicker than her, you would 
not have heard me singing today. 



Tigellinus, wanting to calm Caesar ' s anger, yells out with 
excitement in his face as he raises a glass of wine. 



TIGELLINUS 
On behalf of the city and the world 
I thank you Caesar for destroying 
your mother and freeing us from her 
evil power. 



With contempt Petronius stares at Tigellinus and reaches for 
Nero's emerald monocle, putting it up to his eye. Through it 
he sees the weird party and its already drunk guests, 
hugging, kissing, raising glasses and eating. 

In the background, shadowy slaves move around carrying 
massive trays of food and pitchers of wine. 

The image is drowned by another precipitation of 
multicolored rose petals. Petronius removes the sapphire 
from his eye and hands it to Nero, jolting him from his mad, 
distant stare. 

PETRONIUS 
Close your ears, Nero, lest the 
words of fools hurt them. Your 
world is like an emerald. Rare and 
fragile . 



SCENE 22 NIGHT_INT_ NERO PALACE_ LARGE BANQUETTE HALL 

An already drunk Vinicius wraps his arms around Lygia. She 
tries to get out of his grasp. 

VINICIUS 

Lygia, Lygia. . . ! Kiss me! Caesar 
has promised you to me. . . ! 



SCENE 23 NIGHT_INT_ NERO PALACE_ LARGE BANQUETTE HALL 

Loud noises as Gladiators enter the arena between the 
tables. With bare bodies rubbed in oil, they begin to 
battle. Two guests shake hands. 

FIRST GUEST 
I wager that Croto will wring his 
neck ! 

The fight continues. One of the gladiators wins an 
advantage, choking his opponent and throwing him to the 
ground. 

The winner puts a foot on the back of his foe and crosses 
his arms over his chest in a sign of victory. The hall 
erupts in the cheers of the men and women looking on. 

CROWD 

Croto ! Croto ! Croto ! 



18. 



SCENE 24 NIGHT_INT_ NERO PALACE_ LARGE BANQUETTE HALL 

Vinicius tries to kiss Lygia, in the struggle she knocks 
over a cup of wine. He's drunk, with no control over 
himself. He mumbles, meanwhile Acte tries to stop him. 

VINICIUS 
[Drunk ] Love me, Lygia ! It was I 
that beat the Parthians and bore 
the glory of Rome to the world. And 
now Rome gives me my due reward 
worthy of a hero. You! . . . (his 
speech slurs off into drunken 
mumbling) 

Lygia tries to push him away with her last ounce of 
strength. Acte tries to restrain him. At this moment a 
gigantic form appears above Vinicius. 

A giant — Ursus appears from behind Vinicius and picks Lygia 
up like a doll. They disappear among the guests and 
servants, meanwhile Vinicius is too drunk to realize what's 
happening. 



SCENE 25 DAY_INT_PETRONIUS PALACE_ATRIUM 

House of Petronius. Atrium. Petronius is walking alongside 
the pool, scolding Vinicius, who is hiding his face in his 
hands . 

PETRONIUS 
It is as I feared. This war has 
made a savage of you. You have 
become one of us. A bastard of the 
court . Redbeard can be proud of 
you. I have forfeited the 
friendship of the Plautiuses just 
to decorate your empty head with a 
wreath of withered leaves. 

Vinicius drops his head in shame. Petronius is furious. 

Eunice silently slips into the room and turns towards 
Petronius . 

EUNICE 

Master, I found the man that you're 
looking for and who is looking for 
you. 

From behind Eunice appears a clumsy figure of an old man in 
a torn coat, who bows and mutters. CHILON CHILONIDES. 



19. 



CHILON 

Chilon Chilonides at the service of 
the equal and the more equal. 

Petronius looks the man over with interest and then stares 
at Eunice. He regards her with amusement. Eunice blushes and 
walks out in embarrassment . 



SCENE 26 DAY_INT_PETRONIUS PALACE_ATRIUM 
Chilon smiles at Eunice as she runs out . 

CHILON 

She complains of unrequited love. I 
gave her two threads from the 
mantle of Venus. I have my methods. 

PETRONIUS 
Are you a magician? 

The stranger pulls his clumsy hands from his worn coat. His 
smile contorts his face. 

CHILON 

A philosopher. Master! Do you not 
know? 

Vinicius stands over Chilo. 

VINICIUS 

Do You know what we want from you? 
Chilon squints his eyes. 

CHILON 

I am to find some girl who has been 
abducted by her slave from a feast 
held by Caesar. 

Vinicius yells back in anger. 

VINICIUS 
Only remember, this is not just 
some girl, you villain. It is the 
divine daughter of the King of the 
Lygians, called Callina! 

Chilon stares into Petronius s face, unsure who is in charge 
and who holds the money. He is afraid of Vinicius. 

Petronius calms the situation. 



20. 



PETRONIUS 
Do you have a way to do this? 

CHILON 

If you have the means, sir, I'll 
find a way. 

PETRONIUS 
So you are a philosopher for money, 
in other words a crook. 

Petronius seems cynical, as the newcomer once again fiddles 
with his old coat . 

CHILON 

I'm saving up, to hire a scribe, 
who'll transmit my message to 
posterity. For myself, I do not 
keep a penny. Not even for a coat. 

From one side, Vinicius throws Chilon a bag jingling with 
coins. Even though he wasn't looking, he catches it like a 
juggler. 

VINICIUS 
When will you start ? 

Chilon hides the bag in his jacket. 

CHILON 
I already have! 

His tone becomes confident. 

CHILON 

Noble lords, will you permit me to 
in turn ask a question or two? 

Petronius nods. 

CHILON 

Did you notice the divine Lygia 
having any special marks: amulets, 
tattoos? 

Vinicius shakes his head. Chilon falls back and frowns. 

CHILON 
It won't be easy. 

Vinicius comes to life and suddenly shouts. 



21. 



VINICIUS 

But wait ! I remember now! She drew 
a fish in the sand! 

Chilo twists his head and mutters. 

CHILON 

A Fish? 

VINICIUS 

A Fish. 

CHILON 

I shall do all in my power. . . 
but. . . .you see for yourselves. . . 
you understand. . . 

Showing the holes in his coat as he slowly walks backwards 
towards the exit and disappears. Petronius calls out to him. 

PETRONIUS 
Tell my servant to give you a new 
coat ! 

From outside the door Chilo calls back. 

CHILO (OFF) 
Thou art a true philosopher. 
Master! You hate even the slightest 
injustice. 

Eunice shows up in the doorway looking more beautiful than 
usual . Petronius looks at her in amazement . 

Vinicius interrupts his staring. 

VINICIUS 

What now? 

Petronius puts his fingers to his nose and, changing his 
voice, pretends to be Chilon. 

PETRONIUS 
First we fumigate the house, and 
then ask Eunice to accompany us. 

Eunice runs up to Petronius. He caresses the flowers in her 
hair and asks haughtily. 

PETRONIUS 
Could it be that love really 
exists? Happy is he who experiences 
it. 



22. 



SCENE 27 EVENING_EXT_ DARK ROME STREET 

Darkness . A gloomy path on which Chilon is sneaking beneath 
gray walls. He runs into the first lit building, a winery. 



SCENE 28 EVENING_INT_ WINERY 

The interior of the winery. Chilon sits down at the nearest 
table . 

CHILON 
Wine, Sporus! 

The host puts a pitcher before him. The Greek pushes it 
away. 

CHILON 

Something better than this, you 
swindler! The best in the house! 

He shouts out and throws a gold coin on the table. Sporus 
hands him a chalice. Chilon takes a huge gulp and pours the 
last bit onto the table top. 

He draws the shape of a fish in the wine. Sporus watches 
with a blunt expression. 

CHILO 

Have you ever seen this sign? 

Sporus' face expressionless. A second gold coin falls onto 
the table. 

SPORUS 

All types frequent this place. 
CHILON 

Do you know who these are? 
Sporus mumbles. 

SPORUS 
Fish. . .people? 

A third gold coin falls on the table. 

CHILON 

Can you at least count to three, 
fool? 

Sporus' eyes light up. He grabs the coins and wipes away the 
drawing in the wine. 



23. 



SPORUS 

Fish in Greek is Ichthys. Jesus 
Christ, the Son of God, the 
Saviour. 

CHILO 

Christ? The one who was crucified 
in Judea? 

SPORUS 

The same. 



SCENA 28A BEFORE SUNSET_INT_CRISPUS HOUSE VIEW TO THE ROOM 
WITH A TABLE 

A golden sunset, though the sky is still blue. Chilon sneaks 
up to the home of Crispus and cautiously looks inside. 

At a table are sat: the Apostles Peter and Paul, Crispus, 
Nazarius and Lygia. Peter breaks bread, dips a piece in wine 
and passes it to Paul. He passes out the bread, doing the 
same for all those present . 

This scene is accompanied by music. 



SCENE 29 DAY_INT_PETRONIUS PALACE_ATRIUM 

House of Petronius. In the doorway appears the haggard 
figure of Chilon. 

CHILON 

Pax Vobiscum. Peace be with you. 
Vinicius grabs him, pulls him in and shakes him like a dog. 

VINICIUS 

Where have you been, you villain!? 
He yells through clenched teeth. 
Chilon' s voice breaks as he wheezes. 

CHILON 

Don't choke me. Sir. I'm just a 
philosopher . 

Chilon wheezes and snorts trying to catch his breath. 

VINICIUS 
Where is Lygia? 



24. 



CHILON 

She's safe, among her own people. 
VINICIUS 

Meaning? 

CHILON 

Your divine Lygia is a non-divine 
Christian. 

Vinicius is stopped in his tracks, but after a while, unable 
to find an answer to this news, he turns to Chilon in a more 
friendly tone. 

VINICIUS 
Do you now anything more? 

CHILON 

More means more .... for the both of 
us, less than tomorrow, but a lot 
more than yesterday. 

Chilon is alluding to extra payment . 

VINICIUS 
Haven't I paid you enough? 

CHILO 

Haven't I told you enough. Sir? 

Chilon immediately responds . Vinicius opens a box and pulls 
out another purse with money for Chilon. 

VINICIUS 

Here, take this, and you'll get a 
lot more when you lead me to her. 



SCENE 30 NIGHT_EXT_DARK ROME SUBURBAN STREETS 

Darkness. Two hooded characters move through narrow 
alleyways. Behind them follows a hooded figure, the enormous 
and powerfully built Croto . The shortest of the three 
removes his hood, showing the face of Chilon. 

CHILON 
Who is this. Sir? 



Chilon nods towards the second figure who takes his hood 
off. 



25. 



VINICIUS 
Croto. The Wrestler. 

CHILON 

You are a cautious man. Sir. 
Guarding your virgin is a true 
giant . 

Vinicius shoves Chilon, whose hood falls over his face. 

VINICIUS 

If you have lied to me, Croto will 
count your bones first and then he 
will deal with the giant ! 

CHILON 

But if I'm telling the truth? 



VINICIUS 

You will receive a house and five 
slaves . 

CHILON 

This very night. Christians will be 
gathering in Ostrianum. There is to 
be a man present who knew Christ . 
They call him "The Rock" - Petrus. 
The Apostle Peter. They are going 
to pray together. That's where 
we'll find her. Sir. 



SCENE 31 NIGHT_EXT_RAVINE OUTSIDE ROME 

The three hooded figures are close to the entrance to a deep 
ravine. Around them, ahead, on all sides and at the top of 
the ravine are hundreds of twinkling lights. The lights are 
concentrated in one meandering stream flowing down to the 
bottom of the ravine. 

Vinicius, Chilon and Croto, still hidden beneath their 
hoods, slow their pace, allowing others to hurry past them 
on their way up to the outlet of the ravine. 



SCENE 32 NIGHT_INT_CAVE IN OSTRIANUM 

One of the caves in Ostrianum. Two fires burn by a wall that 
has windows giving a view over distant houses scattered 
along via Nomentana. 



26. 



Lights go out in the houses as the residents go to sleep. 
Someone lights a bonfire with a torch, lighting up the area, 
then follows an interval filled with light and song. The 
shadows of those in attendance reflect off the side of the 
ravine . 

The camera's view is from behind Vinicius and Chilon. The 
men stand far back from the fires. 

By the fire stands the old Apostle Peter. He stands tall and 
straight with dignity and inner strength. The light from the 
fire illuminates his gray head and aged face. He speaks. 
Around him the hooded figures listen. 

CHILON 

That's the one, the first disciple 
of Christ, a fisherman! 

Peter raises his hand, making the sign of the cross, 
blessing the followers, who fall to their knees. 

PETER 

I have come to greet you in the 
name of He who sent me. I have come 
to tell you to renounce luxuries 
and pleasures . To love poverty, 
moral purity and truth. To endure 
patiently all harm and persecution, 
to beware of treachery, and set an 
example for one another. 

In Vinicius' s eyes we see the reflection of the fires. Under 
the influence of Peter's words his face begins to change. In 
the fire reflecting off of his eyes the gentle face of Lygia 
appears . 

PETER 

I saw Him, and he was like light 
and the joy of our hearts, for we 
believed that He rose again and 
though the seas may dry up, and the 
mountains turn to dust. His glory 
shall not pass. . . 

Chilon tugs at Vinicius' s coat. 

CHILON 

There! Take a look! He's right 
there! The giant! 

Vinicius turns his head in the direction of Chilon' s 
pointing finger. He sees the massive Ursus. 



27. 



SCENE 33 NIGHT_INT_CAVE IN OSTRIANUM 

At that moment, the followers begin to sing as they move 
forward to Peter and bow their heads. 

Peter dips a branch in water and baptizes them. 

Lygia stands next to Ursus, staring off in front of her as 
the dancing flames reflect off their faces, making her 
almost transparent. Vinicius takes off his hood. 

VINICIUS 

Lygia ! 

Vinicius rushes forward but Chilon holds him back, grabbing 
him by the coat. 

CHILON 

Wait, Sire! You'll bring disaster 
on our heads. When this is all 
over, we'll follow them, and then, 
in the darkness, this fellow 
here. . . 

Chilon looks at Croto, who is standing behind them with huge 
arms crossed over his chest. He makes a gesture with his 
hands as if breaking Ursus 's bones. He takes one step 
forward and directs his mindless, but faithful gaze on 
Vinicius . 

CROTO 

Now? 



SCENE 34 NIGHT_EXT_RAVINE OUTSIDE ROME 

High on the tops of the ravine we can see the silhouettes of 
those returning home from the Christian meeting. The sky in 
the background is slowly lightening as dawn approaches. 



SCENE 35 NIGHT_EXT_ ROME STREET 
A dark alley. Chilon looks around the corner. 

CHILON 

They went into that house. 

He whispers, nodding towards the gray facade of a house. 
Croto stands in front of the building opposite the entrance. 



28. 



CROTO 

Now? 

From behind him appears the shorter Vinicius. 

VINICIUS 

Now! 

He cries out his decision and leads the way. Then they 
disappear into the hallway leading into the house, while 
Chilon hides behind the corner. 



SCENE 36 NIGHT_INT_CRISPUS HOUSE_ENTRANCE + 
NIGHT_EXT_CRISPUS HOUSE COURTYARD 1 

They walk down a long hallway . A large figure appears and 
blocks their progress. From the darkness emerges the face of 
Ursus . 

URSUS 

And who would you be seeking? 
CROTO 

You! 

Croto screams and throws himself on the giant. 

CROTO 

RAAAAAARUH! [Savage battle cry] 
URSUS 

UNNH! [Grunts in reaction] 
The two giants fight. 



SCENE 37 NIGHT_EXT_CRISPUS HOUSE_COURTYARD 2 

Vinicius runs down the hallway and out into a courtyard. 

By a fireplace burning in the courtyard Lygia sits, 
accompanied by an old man, CRISPUS. 

Vinicius heads towards them. The fire illuminates the faces 
of Lygia and Crispus. 

Vinicius pushes the old man out of the way and grabs the 
girl. He runs back out of the courtyard. In his way lies the 
fallen body of Croto. 

Ursus inflicts a heavy blow to Vinicius' s head. The freed 
Lygia calls out to the giant. 



29. 



LIGIA 

No, Ursus!!! No! Don't kill him! 
Vinicius slumps to the ground. 

FADE OUT 



SCENE 38 DAY_INT_CRISPUS HOUSE_MAIN CHAMBER 
Darkness. Voices can be heard. 

VINICUS (OFF) 

Kill me. 

His voice is full of sorrow. 

CRISPUS (OFF) 
He was lucky; you almost broke his 
neck, Ursus. 

URSUS (OFF) 
In my former life I killed a lot of 
people, but back then I did not 
know Christ . 

LIGIA (OFF) 
Trust in the Lord, Ursus. He knows 
best why you were born with such 
strength . And such a great heart . . . 



SCENE 39 DAY_INT_CRISPUS HOUSE_MAIN CHAMBER 

House of Crispus. Vinicius is lying on a bed with a serious 
head wound. He opens his eyes. 

Crispus leans over the injured Vinicius and wipes his 
forehead with a damp cloth. Ursus looks at him from a 
distance as Crispus treats him. In the corner, there is 
Nazarius sitting on a low stool. He is cutting a piece of 
wood to a form of a little bird. 

Lygia sits at the end of the bed. 

When Vinicius sees her he whispers with all his strength. 

VINICIUS 
It's you, Lygia. 

Lygia looks at him with care. 



30. 



LYGIA 

Peace be with you, Marcus. 
Crispus hands Vinicius a clean slate with a stylus. 

CRISPUS 

God tells us to love our enemy, so 
we have dressed your wounds. Now 
write a note to your people, have 
them come for you. 

Vinicius tries to lift his head. 

VINICIUS 
You want me to leave? Now, when 
I've found Lygia!? I have harmed 
her, it's true. But I swear to the 
gods, to my gods, that I will not 
touch the woman I love more than my 
life. May your God also be my 
witness. Permit me to stay. If only 
for one day. 

Vinicius' head falls back. 

Lygia, emotionally moved by his words, rises from the end of 
the bed with her eyes turned to Crispus. 

LIGIA 

Let him stay. Let him live. 



SCENE 40 DAY_EXT_LAKE WITH A BOAT + DAY_EXT_SUNNY BEACH 
Dream of Vinicius and his POV. 

Water floods his vision. One can see how he is struggling 
with the waves. Around him is darkness, wind, a storm. He's 
struggling, losing strength until he slides under the water. 

With his last ounce of strength, he pulls himself to the 
surface and reaches out to grab the end of an oar, by means 
of which he is hauled into a boat. It turns out the person 
who handed him the oar is Peter. 

The fishing boat is going across a wide fiery lake. A sweet 
angelic hymn begins to play as the boat reaches a shore with 
clean golden sand. 

The white pigeon is silently gliding at the sky. End of POV. 

Vinicius wet and tired after battling the elements lies on 
his back in the boat . 



31. 



Peter is not there anymore, as Lygia bends over Vinicius 
with a gentle, beautiful smile. 

LYGIA 

Come, follow me; I'll show you the 
way! 

FADE OUT 



SCENE 41 DAY_INT_CRISPUS HOUSE_MAIN CHAMBER 

FADE IN 

Vinicius opens his eyes in the house of Crispus. His head 
rests on the lap of Lygia, who is stroking his forehead. 

VINICIUS 
I saw your soul in a dream. 



SCENE 42 DAY_INT_CRISPUS HOUSE_MAIN CHAMBER 

Lygia melts away like a ghost. It was a ghost, a dream. 

Vinicius' s head still rests motionless, but now it's resting 
on a cushion instead of Lygia' s lap. 

URSUS 

Lygia told me you should drink 
this. Master. 

Ursus comes closer to Vinicius and hands him a metal cup 
with some hot brew, the cup hidden in his massive hands. 

VINICIUS 
Are you Lygia' s slave? 

URSUS 

Where we come from, there are no 
slaves . 

VINCIUS 
Where is that? 

URSUS 

Where the forest has no end, where 
there are castles made of wood, and 
a great abundance of honey and 
bread. Where "yes" means "yes" and 
"no" means "no". 



32. 



VINICIUS 

And Lygia? 

URSUS 

When you Romans appeared in our 
forests, Lygia' s father, our king 
died from a Roman arrow. Soon after 
that her mother died. Your leader, 
Plautius took the child under his 
wing. Rome became her home. And 
Christ her consolation. 

There is a transition to a stable from this chamber. You can 
see a donkey, which is eating hay in a shadow and suddenly, 
a face of Lygia, hidden there, listening, close to the 
donkey - appears. 

VINICIUS 

Christ ! Who is he, that he could 
bring consolation to the Romans!? 

URSUS 

He who changes sorrow to joy. And 
death itself, which for you is the 
end of life, is for us the 
beginning. 

Lygia runs out of her hiding and faces Vinicius. 

LYGIA 

Yes! Believing in Christ we cannot 
be unhappy. 

VINICIUS 

And I am happy believing in you. I 
don't need Christ for that. 

LYGIA 

You are mistaken, Marcus. Christ is 
love. 

VINICIUS 

If it is as you say, let me see for 
myself. Be my wife. We will 
celebrate the biggest wedding ever 
seen in Rome. I shall ask the 
emperor himself for his blessing . . . 

Lygia looks at Vinicius. 

Her eyes begin to fill with tears and she runs out of the 
room. 



33. 



SCENE 43 DAY_EXT_CRISPUS HOUSE_COURTYARD 2 

Upset, Lygia runs out of the room and into the courtyard 
where fish are hung up and drying. 

Peter is sitting on a bench, leaning against his staff. Next 
to him sits the taller and more powerfully built APOSTLE 
PAUL. 

NAZARIUS (16) , Peter's compagnion is sitting under the tree. 
HE stays silent, but his nimble finger turn a piece of wood 
and a knife. Now you can see a bird figurine that Nazarius 
sculpts. 

Running through the courtyard, she doesn't notice them until 
Paul speaks . 

PAUL 

God bless you, my child. 
Lygia stops and turns around to look at them. 
Peter taps his staff on the flagstones beneath his feet. 
Lygia lowers her head and approaches them. 

PAUL 

Sit down with us, young lady. 



Lygia sits down on the stones beside the bench and begins to 
listen to their conversation. 

PAUL 

Do you remember how you attended 
the wedding at Canaa in Galilee? 

Peter nods his head with a smile, remembering the old times. 

PETER 

But you wer'nt there! How do you 
know about that? 

PAUL 

You told me all about it yourself, 
remember? 

PETER 

My mind is weakened by old age, but 
John has written everything down. 
Have you read it? 



PAUL 

Yes, I've read the whole thing. You 
went to a wedding, and they ran out 
of wine . 

PETER 

And Jesus called a servant and 
said, "Fill the wine jars with 
water. " 

PAUL 

He blessed the love between the 
woman and the man. 

The apostles now look at Lygia sitting by their feet 
listening to the conversation. 

She begins to blush, but sits in silence with no need to 
speak, just to listen. 

PETER 

While the eyes of the one you love 
remain closed to the light of 
truth, avoid him so that he does 
not lead you into sin. But pray for 
him and know that there's no sin in 
your love. 

Paul glances at Peter. 

PAUL 

Trust in your love. Christ has 
softened hearts even harder than 
the heart of one Roman. 

Peter nods his head. 

PETER 

Thrice I denied our Lord, but he 
forgave me and commanded me to be a 
good shepherd to the people. 

Apostle Paul stands up, turning out to be a large man. 



SCENE 44 NIGHT_INT_PETRONIUS PALACE_LIBRARY 

House of Petronius. He lounges in a seat in his library. 

The soft light of the moon enters to the library. 



Eunice peeks around the corner, looks at Petrnonius as 
always, with love, as he quietly reads verses of Horace 
loud. 



35. 



PETRONIUS 
I will not all die, a greater part 
of me will rise again. As long as 
high priest climbes the Capitoline 
Hill . . . 

Petronius raises his eyes from the pages and continues to 
speak the verse in near silence. 

Petronius can see Eunice looking at him, unaware that she is 
reflected in a huge mirror. He momentarily stops reciting, 
and then suddenly ends the poem aloud, as if speaking to 
Eunice. 

PETRONIUS 
. . .May Melpomene, the muse of song 
take pride in what I have made of 
all talents she gave to me, and 
crown my head with laurel wreath. 

Without taking his eyes off Eunice, he puts down the book. 

PETRONIUS 
Have you ever thought about 
freedom, Eunice? 

Eunice retreats behind her corner, hiding. 

PETRONIUS 
You could leave this place, if I 
were to free you. 

Eunice suddenly appears from around the corner again. 

EUNICE 

Oh no! Please don't do any such 
thing. Master. 

Eunice approaches him from behind as he continues to look at 
her in the large brass mirror. 

PETRONIUS 
Freed, you could go your own way, 
have a husband, children, a life of 
your own. . . 

Eunice falls to her knees. 

EUNICE 
You are my life, my Lord. 



36. 



PETRONIUS 
But admit that you envy the 
beautiful Romans, their fine 
apparel, jewellery, hairstyles, 
lovers. . . 

EUNICE 

Love is not jealous or boastful, is 
not borne up by pride. 

Eunice looks into his eyes and then he sees what kind of 
innocent soul hides behind her beautiful face. He reaches 
out towards her with his hand but doesn't touch her, as if 
he were scared to touch such beauty. He motions to her to 
come closer. 

PETRONIUS 
But what if I sent you to work in 
the fields? What if I married 
another woman? Or had you whipped? 

EUNICE 

Love bears every kind of suffering, 
believes all things, sees hope 
everywhere, endures everything. 

PETRONIUS 
But sooner or later it ends, burns 
out and dies. . . 

Petronius slides out of his seat and reaches out towards 
Eunice without touching her, kneeling in front of her. 

EUNICE 
Love never dies. 



SCENE 45 DAY_INT_PETRONIUS PALACE_ATRIUM 
Vinicius reclines by the pool in Petronius' home. 
He still has a bandage on his head. 

Petronius is sitting across the pool with Eunice on his lap. 
He says irritably. 

PETRONIUS 
And so you have gone quite mad. You 
free your slaves, distribute your 
fortune among the poor . . . 



37. 



VINICIUS 
I have come to believe their 
teaching that happiness, beauty, 
and love are nothing but vanity. 

PETRONIUS 
If you want to repay evil with 
goodness . . . then . . . then what do 
you repay goodness with!? 

Vinicius raises his hand and interrupts Petronius. Petronius 
begins to walk away. 

VINICIUS 

I cannot repay their goodness with 
evil . 

Petronius angrily turns around. 

PETRONIUS 
Do you intend to accept the 
teachings of this . . . Christ?! 

VINICIUS 

When I'm ready. ... J would like you 
to meet him too, Petronius. 

At that moment a beautiful Greek slave enters the room and 
hands Petronius a letter, he reads it and with a sigh throws 
the paper into the pool like a paper boat. 

PETRONIUS 
Caesar orders us to go together to 
Antium. I advise you not to refuse 
such a request. 

VINICIUS 
I cannot leave Lygia. 

PETRONIUS 
If you do not wish to lose her for 
ever, better start packing before 
Redbeard notices your absence 

VINICIUS 

I want nothing from Caesar. If I'm 
going anywhere, then I shall go with 
Lygia and the Plutiuses to Sicily. 
If that is what she wants. . . 



Petronius looks at Vinicius with growing pity. 



38. 



PETRONIUS 
No one is free. Everyone has 
someone above him who decides 
whether he lives or dies. Keep that 
rule in mind. 

Chilon' s contorted face appears in the doorway. 

CHILON 

Psst .... 

VINICIUS 
What is he doing here?! 

Chilon approaches them and reaching the pool, sits down, 
takes off his sandals, and dips his tired feet in the cold 
water. He begins his game with a mysterious expression. 

CHILON 
I know where to find. . . . 

Vinicius jumps to his feet. 

VINICIUS 
You dare not speak her name! 

Chilon is completely suirprised by this turn of events. 

CHILO 

Why is that, sir? What has changed 

since you promised me a house and 

five slaves. Have I not kept my 
word? 

Vinicius grabs Chilon by his coat and lifts him up over the 

pool, his feet dangling above the water. 

VINICIUS 

I'm telling you not to hang around 
here any more and to forget that 
you ever knew us. 

CHILON 

If you drown old Chilo, you' 11 be 
doing a favour to the enemies of 
Rome. Along with me will perish 
matters important to the Entire, 
saved in this head of mine. 

Chilon tries to tap his head. Vinicius eventually throws him 
down at the edge of the pool. 



39. 



VINICIUS 

You are to cease your spying, now! 
And do not show up around! 

Vinicius throws a purse of coins towards the door. 

Chilon runs after it and catches it, already close to the 
exit. He turns around and looks at Vinicius with plots and 
revenge in his mind. 

CHILON 

You're very generous. Sir. Chilo 
will never forget it . 

He gives a low bow an exits. 



SCENE 46-47 EVENING_ANTIUM AT THE SEA SIDE_EXT_TERRACE 

Antium. A large terraced villa. Below can be seen the calm 
waters of the bay. 

NERO 

And so Troy burns, burns, burns. . . 

Nero, with a zither in his hands plays the last two chords, 
pathetically picking at the strings as he leans against a 
rail under a blood red sunset. 

The groan of the zither endlessly prolongs the last notes of 
Nero's poem. 

He looks around at Petronius, Vinicius, Poppea and 
Tigellinus with an expression of boundless pride. 

Tigellinus claps his hands with an idiotic smile as he nods 
his head, as if he was agreeing with what he had just heard. 

NERO 

What do you say? Did you see the 
fire that consumes Troy? 
Tigellinus, you first - what do you 
think of my description. 

Nero is surrounded by Petronius, Vinicius , Poppea and 
Tigellinus. Servants move around silently in the background. 

Nero has just finished reading a poem, now he proudly cocks 
his head and looks at those present. 

Tigellinus claps his hands in appreciation and nods. 



40. 



TIGELLINUS 

Amazing! 

NERO 

Amazing? Tigellinus! But was it 
true? Did you feel the fire burn 
your hands?! 

Tigellinus stutters like a pupil in front of the blackboard. 

TIGELLINUS 
Oh! Divine one! It burned and. . . 
blinded! 

Nero casts Petronius a contemptuous look. 

Moving across, he closely observes Poppea, who with a look 
of indifference on her face, stuffs some grapes into her 
mouth. She has no understanding or interest in the poetry of 
Caesar. 

With a look of disgust, Nero turns around and yells out to 
the servants with an impatient voice. 

NERO 

Clear the tables. Augusta is 
choking. 

Two servants instantly bring out trays and bowls. 

Meanwhile, Nero looks at Petronius intensely. 

Petronius withstands the long stare, and after a long pause 
pronounces his judgment. 

PETRONIUS 
Throw your verse in the fire, 
Caesar; that would be the best 
thing for it. 

Caesar tries to control his anger and squints at him. 

NERO 

What do you find so wrong in my 
description of the fire, Petronius, 
that you would have the fire 
consume it? 

PETRONIUS 
It is too cold. 



NERO 

It burnt Tigellinus. 

PETRONIUS 
Don't believe him, divine Caesar. 
Your talent could wipe Rome from 
the surface of the earth, let alone 
Troy! 

Hearing this, Nero calms down. 

NERO 

It's true. The gods gave me talent. 
That is why I am sharing it with 
you. 

PETRONIUS 
The greatest poet of Rome does not 
look for acclaim from his soldiers, 
but is worthy of eternal glory in 
the pantheon of fame. 

Nero swells with pride and looks at Tigellinus with 
contempt, who shrinks in his armor. 

NERO 

Tigellinus has the mind of a mouse 
and skin thin as a woman's. Come 
back tomorrow, Petronius, and you 
will die in the flames. 

Tigellinus' s face blackens with anger. 

NERO 

As a sculptor seeks his model, so I 
need to see a real fire. 

TIGELLINUS 
At your command. Sire, I will order 
all of Antium to be set alight for 
you! 

NERO 

What is Antium for Caesar! 



SCENE 48 NIGHT_EXT_ANTIUM AT THE SEA SIDE_BEACH 

Antium. Coast. Petronius and Vinicius walk slowly along a 
sandy beach. Jupiter shines like a lantern. 



42. 



VINICIUS 

Aren't you playing with life and 
death? 

Wrapped in his thoughts, Petronius for a moment doesn't 
reply . 

PETRONIUS 
If you want Caesar to agree to your 
wedding with Lygia, he must be 
pleased with himself. 

VINICIUS 
So why do you tease Tigellinus? 

PETRONIUS 
Tigellinus does all he can to 
prejudice Caesar against me. 

Small waves lap the shore. 

VINICIUS 
It is said he who lives by the 
sword, dies by the sword. 

PETRONIUS 
It is also said: if you want peace 
— prepare for war. 

VINICIUS 
How are we to know what it's all 
worth. I'm a soldier and you are a 
diplomat . . . who will judge us? 

PETRONIUS 
You yourself and I myself. 

The late evening horizon is illuminated by the sphere of 
Jupiter, lighting up the way for the two men walking across 
the beach as tiny waves crash onto the shore. 



SCENE 49 EVENING_ANTIUM AT THE SEA SIDE_EXT_TERRACE 
Small waves lap the sands. 

The crackling and popping of burning wood and houses. The 
great fire, born in Nero's head, in his poem, reflects off 
of the water. The flames were born in Nero's head, in Nero's 
poem. 

We can heard only the groan of his zithar. 



43. 



Nero is watching from the terrace of a villa in Antium. He 
turns around and looks at the room of guests, as if waiting 
for applause. 

Petronius speaks first. 

PETRONIUS 
We need air, Caesar. We are 
suffocating and the fires of Troy 
will soon reach us. 

NERO 

What are you saying, Petronius? 
Have the stanzas of my poem made 
such an impression on you? 

PETRONIUS 
I am quite burning up and don't 
know what will quench the fire. You 
have ruined my life. Sire. 
Vinicius, who remains stubbornly 
silent, could say the same, if he 
were not frozen with terror. 

NERO 

What have you to say about my fire 
- you've felt the fire of battle? 

Vinicius freezes, not knowing what to say in response to 
Nero. 

Tigellinus takes advantage. 

TIGELLINUS 
Divine Caesar. Though I have been 
in a hundred battles. . . 

Nero, with a gesture signals him to be silent. He looks at 
Vinicius, expecting an answer. Petronius tries to help. 

PETRONIUS 
Vinicius would rather die than face 
the might of your poems, Nero. 

Nero breaks out into laughter. 

NERO 

Then you shall die, Vinicius, if 
you don't tell me whether you'd 
prefer to receive a poem or a horse 
from me? 

Petronius is bitterly silenced. 



44. 



VINICIUS 

I'd rather have a poem. Sire. Horses 
there are many, but only one 
Caesar. Nothing is worth more than 
his words. 

Nero's face lights up in appreciation and he cries out to 
the servants from the terrace. 

NERO 

Bring me my horse! 
He turns to Petronius. 

NERO 

They think me a monster . . . they 
call me matricidal, they are 
jealous of my talent. The burden of 
magnitude is hard to bear. You 
alone understand me - the Artist ! 

He puts his hand on Petronius' s shoulder. 

Tigellinus as always looks on their relationship with 
jealousy. 

The servants bring along his horse beneath the terrace. 

NERO 

And I do so like to make people 
happy. Vinicius - the steed is 
yours ! 

Confused, Vinicius looks at Petronius. Petronius nods 
reassuringly, implying that you can't refuse Nero. 

Footsteps on the terrace approach from behind. Nero turns 
around. Faon, the freedman falls to his knees in front of 
Nero. 

FAON 

Forgive me, divine emperor! There 
is a fire in Rome! The greater part 
of the town on fire! 

Nero looks at him with curiosity then raises his eyes and 
hands . 

NERO 

Ye Gods! At last I shall see a 
burning city and finish my poem! 



45. 



FAON 

The flames are swallowing up the 
people! Rome is dying. Sire! 

Vinicius walks off down the terrace, not listening to the 
conversation. He jumps on his horse and rides towards Rome. 

Nero turns to Tigellinus. 

NERO 

Tigellinus. Will I be in time to 
see the fire? 

The face of Tigellinus shows great excitement as he savors 
Nero's every word. 

TIGELLINUS 
Sire, the show is for you. 



SCENE 50 NIGHT_EXT_HILLS AROUND ROME 

A horse with its neck outstretched and panting heavily 
rushes past gardens and hedges. Vinicius leans over the 
horse '^s neck. He urges the animal on. 

The horse and Vinicius reach the hill . On the horizon we see 
the city engulfed in gold and pink, with flashes, like 
distant thunder. 



SCENE 51 NIGHT_EXT_HILLS AROUND ROME 

The horse on top of the hill rears up on its hind legs. 
Vinicius calms him down and looks down on the city. 

The burning city can be seen in the distance, a mass of fire 
and smoke. Vinicius heads down towards the city. 



SCENE 52 NIGHT_EXT_ROME STREET IN FIRE 1 

Vinicius tries to navigate with his horse through the 
chaotic crowds in the city. The forms of people are hard to 
see through the thick black smoke. Every now and then a 
terrified face, black from the smoke flashes into view. 

Screams of pain, anger, and curses can be heard. 

VOICES 

Death to Nero! Mother killer! Down 
with the tyrant ! We know he did 
this! Assassins! Arsonists! Hang 
them all! 



46. 



SCENE 53 NIGHT_EXT_ ROME STREET CLOSE TO THE CRISPUS HOUSE 

Vinicius enters the street on which Crispus lives. From the 
entrance of the street fire can be seen. The fire quickly 
moves towards the rider, engulfing and consuming the vines 
surrounding him. The horse rears back in fear. 

A RUNAWAY runs past. Vinicius grabs him by his tunic, almost 
falling off of his horse. 

VINICIUS 
Where are they!? 

RUNAWAY 

There '^s no one here! The Christians 
have left for Ostrianum! 

He disappears in the smoke. The horse turns around. Its 
hooves pound on the flagstones of the street as it 
disappears into the clouds of smoke. 



SCENE 54 NIGHT_EXT_CRISPUS HOUSE_COURTYARD 2 DURING THE FIRE 

Vinicius on horseback enters a Courtyard. There are still 
tongues of fire on the walls and roof. 

Vinicius hangs limply over the horse's neck. He falls, 
rolling onto the grass and lies on his back. His face is 
blackened with smoke. He falls unconscious. 

FADE OUT 



SCENE 55 NIGHT_EXT_BURNING ROME_AQUEDUCT 

FADE IN 

Nero's entourage stops at the edge of an aqueduct. Nero 
takes a few steps forwards and from the top looks down on 
the burning city. They are surrounded by scorched tree 
trunks and a growing angry crowd. 

Nero turns to his entourage and recites a short line with a 
pathetic voice as he gestures towards the burning city. 

NERON 

Homeless ruler of a homeless 
people, where will I lay my 
miserable head this night . . . 

From beneath the aqueduct, the roaring of the crowd grows 
louder. 



47. 



SCENE 56 NIGHT_EXT_BURNING ROME_AQUEDUCT 

Nero tunes his zither and looks down. Striking the strings 
he begins to sing. 

NERO 

Oh star of my ancestors, dear 
birthplace ... Oh star of my 
ancestors, dear birthplace . . . 

After these few words, he throws the zither into a gap in 
the aqueduct where it smashes among the crowd below. 

Nero wraps himself in his robe and stands in statuesque 
pose. A sinister howl comes from the crowd down below. 

CROWD 

Where's Caesar!?! He put us in 
hell! Death to Nero! Mother killer! 
Down with the tyrant ! 

Nodding his head, Nero says plaintively 

NERO 

This is how the people appreciate 
me and my poetry. 

Tigellinus comes up beside him. 

TIGELLINUS 
Have the praetorian guards called 
out to attack them. Sire. 

Petronius comes up on Nero's other side. 

PETRONIUS 
Speak to your people. Sire and 
promise them something. 

Tigellinus glares at Petronius. Nero raises his head to the 
sky and with a heavy sigh sarcastically comments on the 
proposal . 

NERO 

Would you have the divine Caesar 
speak to the rabble? 

Nero stares at Tigellinus. 

NERO 

You go down to them! 
Tigellinus lowers his head in silence. 



48. 



PETRONIUS 
Caesar, I will go. 

NERO 

Yes, you my most faithful ... Go 
and lavish promises on them! 



SCENE 57 NIGHT_EXT_BURNING ROME_AQUEDUCT 

Petronius alone stands on the edge of the aqueduct, staring 
at the crowd. He raises his arms and after a while the 
hubbub subsides. 

CROWD 

Petronius! Jfs Petronius! 
PETRONIUS 

Citizens ! 

From afar, Nero listens to Petronius, adding his own 
comments to the speech. 

NERO 

. . .And you scum. . . 

PETRONIUS 
The city will be rebuilt . 

NERO 

...as soon as we're done with the 
show. . . 

PETRONIUS 
Caesars gardens will be opened to 
you. 

NERO 

...just don't throw any garbage 
around or bring your goats. . . 

PETRONIUS 
From tomorrow, grain, wine and oil 
will be handed out! 

NERO 

. . . fill your bellies till you 
choke. . . 

PETRONIUS 
Then Caesar will organise for you 
games such as Rome has never seen 
before . 



49. 



NERO 

. . and will never see again. . . 

PETRONIUS 
Great feasts and generous gifts 
await you! 

NERO 

. . .Rome has burnt to the ground - 
long live Rome! 

CROWD 

Bread! Bread! Games! Bread and 
games! Bread! Bread! Games! Bread 
and games! 



SCENE 58 DAY_EXT_CRISPUS HOUSE_COURTYARD 2 BURNED AFTER THE 
FIRE 

Nazarius leans over Vinicius and splashes the rider's face 
with water. Marcus Vinicius opens his heavy eyelids. The sun 
temporarily blinds him. 

NAZARIUS 

Our house is burned down. Master! 

Vinicius tries to pick himself up. 

VINICIUS 
Where is she?! 



SCENE 59 DAY_INT_ROME_UNDERGROUND CAVERN 

An underground cavern. A few lights give a faint glow. The 
cavern is filled with people kneeling and praying. 

NAZARIUS (OFF) 
There are caves beyond the gardens 
of Agrippina. They have taken 
shelter there. 

Standing against a wall is a more clearly illuminated Peter 
the Apostle. He makes the sign of the cross with his hands. 

PETER 
Peace be with you! 

The crowd responds with a murmur of pained and fearful 
voices. 



50. 



CROWD 

Do not abandon us! Do not leave us 
on this day of judgment! 

Peter raises his hands. 

PETER 

Woe to the world, and woe to the 
sinful. Fire has come to the city 
of crime, but the Lord has shown 
mercy to those of you washed by 
baptism! Peace be with you! 

Peter moves among the crowd, blessing them. 

Suddenly, he stands opposite Vinicius . Vinicius bows his 
head low. He looks around and sees a vat of water. Someone 
hands him a twig with a few leaves still swaying on it. 
Peter dips it into the water and sprays Vinicius with it, 
baptizing him. 

PETER 

I baptize you in the name of the 
Father, the Son and the Holy 
Spirit. Follow me. 



SCENE 60 DAY_INT_ROME_MODEST COTTAGE HOUSE_CHAMBER 

Interior of a modest cottage on the outskirts of the city. 

Lygia is busy hanging fish on a line. She does not see 
Vinicius who has entered and is standing, watching his 
beloved Lygia. 

When Lygia turns and sees Vinicius, she for a moment does 
not know what to do. But her feelings overcome her doubt and 
she throws herself into his arms. There is a wooden pigeon 
sculptured by Nazarius sitting over their heads, on the 
ledge in the wall. 

VINICIUS 

I promised you that I'd never leave 
you. . . 

LYGIA 

And then I'll say "where you go 
Caius, there go I Caia". 

VINICIUS 
This very day we'll sail for 
Sicily. My house is your house. 



51. 



LYGIA 

My heart is your heart . 

During this time Peter the Apostle has also entered the 
room. As he sees them in such a love and community, he 
approaches them and takes Vinicius'^s right hand and joins it 
with Lygia' s right hand. 

PETER 

Love one another. There is no sin 
in this love of yours. 

Vinicius looks into the eyes of Lygia. 

VINICIUS 

I, Marcus Vinicius, take you Lygia 
Callina for my wife and promise 
that I will not leave you for as 
long as I live. 

Lygia looks into his eyes. 

LIGIA 

So help us. Lord God Almighty. 
Nazarius runs into the room. 

NAZARIUS 

The gladiators have revolted. They 
are killing everyone! 

Peter silences him with a gesture and directs his words to 
Vinicius . 

PETER 

This is a great evil . . . 

In the distance we hear the growing roars of lions collected 
in an animal pit . 

VINICIUS 

Don't stray away. Father. I'll come 
for you. 

Vinicius straitens Lygia for the last time and runs out of 
the room. 

The roars of the lions become increasingly loud and clear. 
There are upcoming screams of people, as well. 



52. 



CROWD 

This way! Run! God! Help us! 
Horror overcomes the faces of those gathered. 

PETER 

Did He abandon His flock? 

FADE OUT 



SCENE 61 DAY_INT_ROME_PALATINO_NERO' S CHAMBER 

FADE IN 

Palatino. Nero's chamber . Petronius stares at Nero. 

PETRONIUS 
Sire, you need to go to Hellas. 
It's getting too dangerous in Rome. 

Tigellinus abruptly interrupts him. 

TIGELLINUS 
That is not a good idea! Civil war 
could erupt before you get to 
Ostia, Sire! The Praetorians may 
betray us! 

Angry voices from a crowd approaches from a distance. 

CROWD 

Death to the arsonists of Rome! 
Mother killer! Coward! Death to the 
tyrant ! Arsonist ! Burn him at the 
stake ! Burn them all ! 

NERO 

They have enough grain and oil, 
what more do they want? 

TIGELLINUS 

Vengeance . 

Nero squints and collects his thoughts for a moment . 
Suddenly an idea comes to mind and he smiles evilly. 

NERO 

And vengeance requires a victim, 
Tigellinus. You must go out to them 
and admit it was you who set fire 
to Rome. 



53. 



Tigellinus looks petrified. After a moment he looks at 
Nero's with defiance. 

TIGELLINUS 
I burned Rome on your orders! 

Nero and Tigellinus measure each other like wild beasts. 

The sudden voice of Faon standing in the doorway to the hall 
interrupts the moment . 

FAON 

The divine Poppea wishes to see 
Tigellinus . 



SCENE 62 DAY_INT_ROME_PALATINO_POPPEA' S CHAMBER 

Poppea' s Chamber. The Empress lies on a bed holding the 
collar of a huge leopard. In front of Tigellinus - Chilon. 

TIGELLINUS 
So, you say that Vinicius . . . ? 

CHILON 
Yes, Master. 

TIGELLINUS 
And how about Petronius? 

CHILON 

Perhaps! It may very well be. 
Poppea bursts into hysterical laughter. 

POPPEA 

Don't be ridiculous, Tigellinus. 
Petronius, that lover of life and 
pleasure - a Christian? You won't 
protect us with this. The anger of 
the people will turn against Nero 
and will fall on me. 

Chilon falls to his knees and crawls towards Tigellinus, 
glancing at Poppea the entire time. 

CHILON 

Vinicius is with them. I swear! 
Lygia too is a Christian . They have 
married. They mean to disappear 
from sight, and leave Nero in this 
stench of a burnt city. 



54. 



TIGELLINUS 
You came here with with? You have 
nothing on Petronius? ! 

Chilon rubs his fingers together insinuating money. 
Tigellinus rejects him with a kick. 

CHILON 

Catch the nephew in the net, and 
the uncle will fall into the trap 
of his own accord. And may I count 
on your good graces. Master? 



SCENE 63 DAY_INT_ROME_PALATINO_NERO' S CHAMBER 

The room in which Nero resides. Poppea and Tigellinus enter. 

Nero laughs sheepishly, clearly nervous. From afar, under 
the Palatine, the screams of the crowd can be heard. 

CROWD 

The mother killer set fire to Rome! 
Death to Nero! 

NERO 

It's getting nasty. We had better 
make our escape to Hellas. 

Caesar walks over to Tigellinus. 

TIGELLINUS 
The people already know that it was 
Caesar who set fire to Rome! 

NERO 

If I so desire, I can turn the 
people against you. 

TIGELLINUS 
I haven't killed my mother. They 
remember Agrippina and haven't 
forgiven you that... crime. 

NERO 

You played your part in it. 

TIGELLINUS 
As in everything that goes on in 
the palace. 



Silence . 



55. 



Petronius listens from the side of the room, looking out 
from a window at the hills covered by the figures of the 
growing crowd. 

PETRONIUS 
Do my ears deceive me, Nero; do you 
really intend to let this 
muscle-bound fool have the last 
word? ! 

Tigellinus looks at Petronius as if he had been struck with 
an arrow in the windpipe. All of a sudden he takes a more 
conciliatory tone. 

TIGELLINUS 
The people need revenge and. . . 
someone to sacrifice. You have 
heard. Sire, of the followers of 
this prophet, Christ? As soon as we 
agreed to have him hung on the 
cross, they made a God of him. It 
was they who set fire to Rome! 

Nero's face begins to assume an expression of anger, grief 
and indignation. 

NERO 

What did this poor city do to 
deserve such a crime ... at their 
hands? And what is Rome to do now, 
with these beasts? 

Poppea walks up to the emperor. 

POPPEA 

They are your enemies! Punish the 
arsonists ! 

TYGELLINUS 
They go around the city trying to 
convince people to turn against 
Caesar. 

Nero makes another theatrical gesture. 

NERO 

What punishment and torment fits 
such a crime? 

Petronius comes out of the shadows, silently and intently 
watching the faces of Poppea and Tigellinus and then Nero. 
He starts to talk with a growing power in his voice. 



56. 



PETRONIUS 
Beware, Sire, for they will say 
that Nero burned Rome, but threw 
the blame on the innocent . Nero - 
the coward. 

Tigellinus stands by Nero. 

TIGELLINUS 
One word from you, and Petronius 
will forever hold his peace. 

Nero looks at Petronius , cocking his head, feeling hurt . 

NERO 

Though he has wounded my heart, I 
still love him like a brother. 

PETRONIUS 
If you treat your brother as you 
treated your mother, there will 
soon be nobody in the world to love 
you. 

Petronius walks out silently. 



SCENE 64 DAY_EXT_PETRONIUS PALACE_COLLONADE + PETRONIUS 
PALACE_HALL_VIEW THROUGH THE WINDOW 

House of Petronius . PORTERS quickly bring a litter through 
the gate. Petronius gets out and heads towards the entrance. 
Eunice is there to greet him. 

EUNICE 

Vinicius was waiting for you! He 
wanted to say goodbye. This very 
day, he departs with Lygia for 
Sicily. 

Petronius embraces her affectionately. 

PETRONIUS 
And if it should happen that we had 
to part? 

EUNICE 

Where you go. Master, there I go. 



PETRONIUS 
Some voyages have to be taken 
alone. 



EUNICE 
Take me with you. 

Petronius strokes her golden hair and with his arm around 
her they both enter the house. 

From inside can be heard their voices, interirupted by 
Eunice' s laughter, as if they were children playing. 

PETRONIUS (OFF) 
I have no right to decide about the 
life of the beautiful Eunice. 

EUNICE (OFF) 
Eunice belongs to you. 

PETRONIUS (OFF) 
Then I am the happiest man in Rome. 
There are some things that cannot 
be taken from me. 



SCENE 65 PETRONIUS PALACE HALL VIEW THROUGH THE WINDOW 

He has barely crossed the threshold of his house, when 
Petronius must regretfully put an end to Eunice's joy. 

PETRONIUS 
Forgive me. I do not ask you to 
accompany me. 

His face maintains a carefree expression, trying to hide his 
depression . He kisses Eunice on the forehead, turns around, 
and disappears into his library. 



SCENE 66 NIGHT_INT_PETRONIUS PALACE_LIBRARY 

Library. Petronius is writing, leaning over his desk. We see 
his outline from behind, along with the outline of columns 
leading to the garden. 

After a few moments, Paul the Apostle appears in the 
entrance. He stands for a moment looking at Petronius. 

PAUL 

You do not want her to accompany 
you and you are setting her free. 
Note well God's goodness and 
severity: he was severe with cut 
branches, and for you he is good - 
if you persist in this goodness. 

At the sound of his voice, Petronius looks up, confused. 



58. 



PETRONIUS 
Who are you? A thief? 

PAUL 

They told me I would find Vinicius 
here. I say to you, I, Paul, a 
servant of Christ Jesus, called to 
be an apostle to preach the good 
news from God. 

Petronius snorts and laughs bitterly. 

PETRONIUS 
"Enemy of Rome!" "Arsonist" ! Are 
you here seeking revenge? 

PAUL 

Do not mete out justice yourselves, 
but leave that to God. "I mete out 
punishment, and I will repay for 
everything" - says the Lord. Don't 
be overcome by evil, but overcome 
evil with good. 

Stunned by the discussion, Petronius stands up and paces the 
room. 

PETRONIUS 
Good? What is that compared to 
wealth, fame and happiness, which 
the tyrant can destroy at a 
moment ' s notice ? 

PAUL 

Wish well for those who persecute 
you. Live in harmony with one 
another. Do not pretend to love, 
but really love other people. 

PETRONIUS 
Death cancels everything . Have you 
not heard the groans of victims? 

PAUL 

If we believe that Jesus died and 
rose again, God will take those who 
have died in Jesus and lead them 
into eternity. 

PETRONIUS 
If God is on your side, what will 
become of those who are against 
you? 



59. 



Petronius lifts his head to hear the reply, but Paul is no 
longer there. 



SCENE 67 AFTERNOON_EXT_ROME_STREET VIEW_FORUM ROMANUM 

Street of Rome. Crowd. You can hear the roar and drunken 
singing of the crowd among the ruins of the still smoking 
city. 

CROWDS 

Christians to the lions! They 
poison our wells! Let the animals 
at them! Get rid of these fanatics! 
Death to all Christians! Death to 
all Christians ! 

The litter with Vinicius is having trouble moving through 
the crowd. After a while it disappears into the smoke. 



SCENE 69 DAY_INT_PETRONIUS PALACE_LIBRARY 

Petronius stands with his back to the library table, exactly 
where Paul stood before. Standing in the dark corner, he 
looks out the window at the vegetation growing around the 
columns of the atrium. 

He doesn't turn round at the sound of Vinicius approaching. 

VINICIUS (OFF) 
Caesar has accused the Christians 
of setting fire to Rome! 

Vinicius, angry, runs into the library. 

PETRONIUS 
Have you hidden her? 

VINICIUS 
They sent over a hundred 
Praetorians after them. They took 
everyone away. The elderly, women 
and children. Did you know about 
this? 

PETRONIUS 
Let's say that I underestimated 
Tigellinus. What about Lygia? 

VINICIUS 

Apparently she's together with the 
others in prison . 



60. 



Petronius claps his hands. Out of nowhere his female 
servants appear. 

PETRONIUS 
Bring swords and mantles . 

Finally Petronius turns around, but his face is still hidden 
in the shadows. 

PETRONIUS 
You'll have to bribe the guards to 
release her immediately. Otherwise 
it will be too late! 

VINICIUS 

Talk to Caesar. Nero loves you. He 
will release her for you. 

PETRONIUS 
Do you think a man who sentenced 
his own mother to death can love? 
Today, I'm the first he would 
deprive of a voice and the last 
person he'd like to hear. 



SCENE 70 DAY_EXT_ROME_PRISON GATE 

Dressed in mantles, Petronius and Vinicius approach the 
prison walls. As they get closer they see a double line of 
soldiers surrounding the sealed entrance to the prison. 

CROWD 

Arsonits ! They burned down Rome! 
Death to Christians! Let the 
animals at them! Get rid of these 
fanatics! Death to 
Christians! Throw them to the 
lions! Let's rid the city of these 
fanatics! Death to all Christians! 
Let's see their God save them now! 

Petronius searches for the commander, eventually spots him 
and approaches him. It is KRICSOS. 

PETRONIUS 
Hail, Kricsos! You have 
been ordered to guard the jail? 



Kricsos stands at attention. 



61. 



KRICSOS 

Yes, noble Petronius. The Prefect 
fears there may be an attempt to 
free the arsonists. 

PETRONIUS 
My slave is in there. This is some 
mistake. I know her well and I know 
that she had nothing to do with 
them. 

KRICSOS 

My orders are to let no one out! 

Despite this, Petronius takes a step forward, Niger blocks 
his path. 

PETRONIUS 
Don't you dare. . . . 

You can hear the clinking of weapons from the PRAETORIAN 
GUARDS. 

KRICSOS 
That means no one. Sir. 

VINICIUS 

And are you also forbidden to let 
anyone in? 

KRICSOS 
.... That was not prohibited. 

VINICIUS 

So tell your men to let me through 
the cordon. I want to find those 
who burned down my house. 

After a few moments of debating this in his head, Kricsos 
gives his men the signal to let them in. 

Vinicius turns round, embraces Petronius, says goodbye and 
enters the prison. 



SCENE 71 DAY_INT_ROME_PRISON 

Vinicius passes over the threshold of the prison and is 
enveloped in darkness . The hallways and cells are filled 
with people. They stand calmly, quietly, most of them are 
praying. Words of prayer reverberate throughout the prison. 



62. 



CROWD 

Our Father who art in 
heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy 
kingdom come. Thy will be doneon 
earth as it is in heaven. Give us 
this day our daily bread, and 
forgive us our trespasses, as we 
forgive those who trespass against 
us, and lead us not into 
temptation, but deliver us from 
evil . 

In the meantime, Vinicius wanders around helplessly, looking 
for Lygia. A CENTURION approaches Vinicius; he leans over 
and whispers in his hear. 

CENTURION 
I've seen you before. Sir. In 
Ostrianum. 

VINICIUS 
Are you. . . .? 

With his long Gallic sword the centurion draws a fish in the 
sand. 

VINICIUS 
I must find Lygia. 

CENTURION 
She's no longer here. 

Vinicius grabs him by the shoulder. 

VINICIUS 
Do you know where she is now? 

The centurion shakes his head. 

VINICIUS 

Well, do you know how to get out of 
here? 

Centurion turns around, nods his head towards Vinicius and 
disappears into the darkness. 



SCENE 72 DAY_EXT_ROME_PRISON EXIT_STREET 

Vinicius exits through a side door from the darkness of the 
prison and comes out into afternoon sunlight . 



63. 



He takes a few steps and encounters the Apostle Paul . He 
sees him, however, from a distance across the entire width 
of the street. The Apostle looks in Vinicius's face. A 
litter passes between Paul and Vinicius. 

The voices of its PORTERS can be heard. 

PORTERS 

Make way for the noble Chilo! Make 
way! 

Vinicius grabs the edge of the litter and tips it in his 
direction. Chilon slides across to him, his eyes wide with 
surprise . 

VINICIUS 
Greetings to you, Chilo. 

Chilon tries to cover his face with his arm. 

CHILON 

Hail, Vinicius, but do not hold me 
up. I hasten to my friend 
Tigellinus ! 

Vinicius grabs him by the robe and screams. 

VINICIUS 
It was you who betrayed them! 

Chilon replies arrogantly. 

CHILON 

My friend, if you have a request, 
come to my house. I welcome all 
visitors and clients in the 
morning, after I have taken my 
bath. 

Vinicius is still half holding on to his tunic. 

SLOW MOTION. Some invisible force pulls Vinicius back. He 
looks back and meets the eyes of Paul . In one flash of truth 
there is an explosion of energy and agreement between the 
two men. 

Vinicius turns his head back on Chilon and looks deeply into 
his eyes. 

VINICIUS 
May God forgive you. 

Vinicius then finally lets go of his tunic and lets the 
litter pass on. 



64. 



Vinicius then looks back to where Paul was standing, but he 
is already gone. 



SCENE 73 DAY_EXT_APPIAN ROAD + DAY_EXT_APPIAN ROAD_PANORAMA 

Appian Road is empty at this time of a day. There is only a 
long shadow of PETER THE APOSTLE, who looks ahead at the 
hilly surrounding area. Beneath his hood you can see his 
grave expression and tired face. 

The sun begins to appear from over the hillsides. Peter 
shields his eyes with his hand, trying to see the white 
pigeon, which flapped its wings loudly. 

Peter sinks to his knees, resting his hands and head on his 
staff. Around his outline appears a pulsing, golden light . 

Than the single beam of light splits like a prism into two 
streaks - one of them is pale pink - another clear, 
luminous . 

The staff slides from under him and he falls face down in 
the Sand, his head still covered by his hood. Peter 
stretches his hands forward as if reaching for someone' s 
feet. 

Silence falls. The golden light fades. Peter raises his head 
slightly. 

PETER 
Quo Vadis, Domine? 

VOICE 

If you abandon my people, I shall 
go to Rome to be crucified once 
again . 

PETER 
Christ! Forgive me! 

Suddenly, there is Nazarius coming from the distance. He 
pulls the bridle of a gray Donkey. The Donkey denies to go 
with four hooves. Each step is difficult for them. 

Nazarius managed to pull up the Donkey. 

The confused face of Nazarius as he bends down over the old 
man . Then from above them a pained voice speaks out . 

The golden light fades as Nazarius grabs Peter and helps him 
up off his knees. 



65. 



NAZARIUS 
Let US not delay, Peter, at any 
time they may catch up with us 
here. 

The Apostle Peter gets up, and leaning on his cane turns 
around to stare in the direction of Rome. Suddenly he heads 
back towards the city. Nazarius catches up to him and grabs 
his arm, trying to stop him. 

NAZARIUS 
Where are you going. Master? 

Peter slowly turns his head, holding his staff in one hand 
and pointing towards the city with the other. 

PETER 

To Rome! 

In the distance you can see the Circus. 



SCENE 74 DAY_EXT_ROME_CIRCUS 

The Arena of the big Circus. View from the imperial terrace 
towards the audience. 

Nero sits on an elevated podium with the magnificently 
dressed Poppea beside him. They are surrounded by the court. 

Petronius is sitting next to Tigellinus . Chilon is on the 
right hand side. The place to the left of Petronius is 
empty. Petronius looks around. 

Vinicius takes a seat next to his uncle. 

PETRONIUS 
Have you found her? 

Vinicius shakes his head. 

Nero looks towards Petronius and Vinicius. 
He gets up. The crowd in the Circus roars and cheers. 

CROWD 

Nero! Nero! Divine Augustus! 
Christians to the lions! 



66. 



SCENE 75 DAY_EXT_ROME_CIRCUS 

Arena. Massive gates are located on the left and right side 
of the arena. The shrill sound of trumpets breaks the 
silence . 

As soon as the trunqjets fall silent, the gate on the right 
side opens with a crash. From the black depths of the open 
gate emerge human figures that slowly move towards the 
center of the arena. The crowd in the Circus inurznurs. 

CROWD 

Christians! Christians! Christians! 

The Christians huddle together in the middle of the arena, 
squinting under the sun. They kneel and bow their heads 
together while holding each other. 

CROWD 

Bring on the animals! The animals! 

The trumpets begin to play again. The gate on the left side 
of the Circus opens . From a black tunnel emerges a lion . 
Behind it, more lions rush out. 

The animals sniff the air, growl and squint in the bright 
light. The crowd Howls with delight. 

From the middle of the cluster of Christians comes the song 
-"Christus Regnat". 



SCENE 76 DAY_EXT_ROME_CIRCUS 

The scene is accompanied by music. Images shown from a 
distance, without dramatic shots. 

Nero's terrace. With his sapphire monocle, Caesar looks out 
on the arena. Poppea's eyes shine with excitement. She 
embraces her husband' s neck and shoulders. 

Tigellinus wears an expression of contempt and triumph. 

A lion lurks closer, readying to pounce on the tight cluster 
of kneeling people. He pounces and seizes in its mouth the 
neck of an old man. 

The crowd goes wild. 

Increasingly horrified by this sight, Chilon slides lower 
and lower into his seat . 

The lions drag their victims across the sand, the arena is 
now filled with the screams of those being murdered. 



61. 



SCENE 11 DAY_EXT_ROME_CIRCUS 

Chilon' s head is tilted back unnaturally. Face pale, eyes 
closed, sweaty forehead. With a wild roar of laughter, 
Tigellinus jerks Chilon' s arm. 

TIGELLINUS 
Look! Look! This is your doing! 

Petronius from behind Tigellinus reaches out towards Chilon. 
With his carved cane he taps lightly on his pulsating Adam's 
apple . 

PETRONIUS 
The gods created him a foul 
villain . He has become a veritable 
demon! But even a demon cannot 
endure this. 

Chilon wheezes, his eyes shut tight . He reaches breaking 
point . 

CHILON 
Enough, Caesar! Enough! 

Vinicius looks up. He sees something and nudges Petronius' s 
arm. Petronius follows his gaze. At the top of the arena 
stands Peter, making the sign of the cross with his hand. 
Standing in the light, he looks like a ghost. 

VINICIUS 
Look! Peter is here! 

Peter's piercing eyes are looking straight at Petronius. 
Instead of Peter, all he can see is s pigeon in an oncoming 
white pigeon. 

PETRONIUS 
I can't see anyone. 

Peter's piercing eyes are looking straight at Petronius, 
even though he denies his existence. Suddenly, a big white 
pigeon is appearing, where Peter was supposed to stand. 

Some strange energy passes between them. The howling of the 
crowd in the Circus mixes with the roars of the maddened 
animals . 

Tigellinus leans into Nero's ear. 

TIGELLINUS 
I have something even better 
arranged for tomorrow. 



68. 



SCENE 78 TWILIGHT_EXT_ROME_PALATINO GARDENS 

Twilight . Palatine Gardens . The area where cypress trees 
once grew is now covered with large crosses . On these are 
tied half naked people, their arms attached to the crosses 
by thick ropes, their heads hanging down, their bodies 
covered in bruises and marks from beatings. 

The crosses are draped in dry garlands of ivy. Suddenly a 
large peal of truii^ets. 

Nero looks down on the scene from the windows of the 
Palatine . He makes a gesture and puts his monocle to his eye 
to examine the nearest cross. On it hangs Crispus. 

Standing next to Nero is the pale Chilon, swaying on his 
feet. 



SCENE 79 TWILIGHT_EXT_ROME_PALATINO GARDENS 

Darkness falls. Close-up of the crucified Crispus. His head 
slowly rises. 

The victim is still alive. He opens his eyes and stares at 
Chilon. His chapped lips move silently, his chest rising 
with each breath as his face shines. He whispers. 

CRISPUS 

I forgive and ask for forgiveness. 

TIGELLINUS 
Set the fire. 

The ivy is immediately lit, lighting up the main avenue of 
the garden as the flames travel up the shafts of the 
crosses . 

Chilon' s white robe shines yellow and purple in the 
reflection of the fires. He hides his face in his hands and 
is shaken by spasms. 



SCENE 80 TWILIGHT_EXT_ROME_PALATINO GARDENS 

Chilon runs down the middle of the avenue past the burning 
crosses, the flames whipping at him as he tries to find an 
exit from the garden. Once past the fires, he trips and 
falls, crashing to the ground. 



69. 



SCENE 81 TWILIGHT_EXT_ROME_PALATINE GARDENS 

A hooded figure bends over Chilon and touches his arm. 
Chilon fears to open his eyes. 

CHILON 
I am cursed, damned. 

The face of Paul emerges from under the hood. 

PAUL 

I bring you salvation. 
CHILON 

For me there can be no salvation. 

Paul then draws a cross on his forehead. From Chilon' s chest 
comes a moan. 

CHILO 

Christ ! 

The Apostle Paul disappears back into the darkness. 



SCENE 82 TWIGLIHT_EXT_ROME_PALATINE GARDENS 
Trumpets, noise and fanfare. 

Suddenly out of the darkness emerges a figure wearing a soot 
covered robe. He stands in front of the imperial retinue. It 
is Chilon. He points at Nero. 

CHILO 

Murderer of your own mother! Woe to 
you! It was you who set fire to 
Rome. And Rome will have its 
vengeance on you. Your time has 
passed. 

He points dramatically at the burning crosses. 

CHILON 

I swear that the innocent are being 
killed here. The arsonist of Rome 
is this one! This man! 

With his right hand Chilon points at Nero and freezes in 
that pose. Silence falls. At first single voices are heard, 
then a growing number of ominous cries rise up from the 
crowd. 



70. 



CROWD 

Arsonist! Murderer! Tyrant! Mother 
Killer! Despot! Redbeard! Down with 
Caesar! Down with tyranny! 



SCENE 83 TWIGLIGHT_EXT_ROME_PALATINE GARDENS 

A still burning stake collapses in front of the caravan of 
horses, scaring them and knocking Chilon to the ground. His 
head and neck are showered with sparks and burning 
splinters. The frightened horses panic and stampede, 
trampling Chilon. Wheels run over his limp body. 

FADE OUT 



SCENE 84-85 DAY_INT_ROME_PALATINO_NERO' S CHAMBER

VOICES (OFF) 
Arsonist! Murderer! Tyrant! Mother 
Killer! Nero the murderous dog! Who 
set our city on fire?! You burnt my 
house, you dog! We will have 
vengeance ! 

Chamber in Pallatino - the palace of the emperor. Nero is 
walking around the chamber. 

TIGELLINUS 
The ship is waiting in Naples, 
Caesar. 

NERO 

So we shall take a vacation on 
Hellas after all? 

Petronius stands before Caesar. 

PETRONIUS 
Before you sail Sire, and deprive 
us of your divine presence, do 
faithful Petronius one last favour. 

NERO 

What's that supposed to mean? 

PETRONIUS 
Bless the young couple. 



71. 



NERO 

You're getting married? 

PETRONIUS 
Vinicius wants to marry the Lygian 
hostage . 

TIGELLINUS 
Nero, she's one of them. She's in 
the prison. 

PETRONIUS 
She found herself there through 
your stupidity, Tigellinus. 

Tigellinus' s face turns black with anger. Nero squints 
suspiciously . 

NERO 

One thing that worries me, 
Petronius, is that you take sides 
with the arsonists. 

Now Nero looks at Tigellinus. 

NERO 

We will organise a wedding the 
likes of which Rome has never seen. 



SCENE 86 TWILIGHT_EXT_ROME_PETRONIUS PALACE_COLLONADE 

Twilight. In front of Petronius' s home. The sky is covered 
in driving clouds. Fires lit in the house cast long shadows 
along the walls. 

Leaning against the columns of the house is Vinicius, 
waiting for word from Petronius. At the sight of his 
chariot, he jumps up and waits at the front for it to stop. 

VINICIUS 

Tell me that you bring her freedom! 

Petronius does not reply right away. Then from the darkness 
appears a figure in a gray tunic. He's obviously in hiding. 
He looks around nervously, making sure he isn't being 
followed. He whispers. 

NAZARIUS 
Is that you, noble Vinicius? 



72. 



VINICIUS 

Nazarius? Where did you come from? 
NAZARIUS 

I have a message from Lygia. In her 
fever she keeps repeating your 
name. Ursus is with her. 

VINICIUS 
How do you know this? 

NAZARIUS 
I know a centurion. 

VINICIUS 
I'm going with you! 

Nazarius begins to run off in panic. He stops, turns, and 
from a distance conveys the most important part of his 
message . 

NAZARIUS 
Lygia asks you. Master, to 
persevere in your love and trust of 
God. 

Nazarius raises his eyes towards heaven. The moonlight 
filters directly onto his face. Suddenly the heavens open 
with lightning and thunder. The sudden downpour soaks them. 
Nazarius disappears in the pouring rain and darkness. 
Vinicius cries out to him, but the rain drowns out his 
words . 

VINICIUS 
I will wait for her! Always! 

Petronius wraps his arm around Vinicius and forcefully 
brings him inside. 

PETRONIUS (OFF) 
Pull yourself together, soldier. Or 
pray, if you know how. 



SCENE 87 DAY_EXT_ROME_CIRCUS 

Circus. Brilliant sunlight. Nero is on the terrace. With him 
is Tigellinus, Poppea, and even Hasto, Pitagoras and Faon. 
The sand in the arena has turned to pools of mud from the 
rain . 



73. 



Petronius sits away from Nero, in an adjacent terrace, next 
to Vinicius, who is as white as a sheet. With dark rings 
under his eyes, he stares at the gates. Behind them armed 
PRAETORIANS hold prisoners . 

As always, a peal of trumpets marks the beginning of the 
spectacle. Nero is curious how the spectacle is affecting 
Petronius and his nephew. He can't resist staring at them 
through his monocle. 

Suddenly he bursts out laughing and shouts to Tigellinus, 
who is leaning on Nero's chair. 

NERO 

I underestimated you, Tigellinus. 
You're worse than me. 

TIGELLINUS 
I had lessons from the best master, 
Nero. 

NERO 

I can do anything, but you've 
managed to amaze Petronius himself. 
Look ! 

Petronius looks pale and exhausted. He slowly stands up. Now 
he can be seen standing tall above the others, staring at 
one point in the arena. He slowly turns his head and looks 
straight at Nero. Very slowly and clearly he speaks over the 
noise of the truiiqsets. 

PETRONIUS 
If their God really exists, what 
will become of those who are 
against Him? 

The gate on the right opens, revealing the dark abyss of a 
tunnel . 

A moment later a huge athletic figure emerges. Ursus enters 
the arena. Struck almost blind by the rays of the sun, he 
squints and looks around. He is half naked and devoid of any 
weapon. He kneels down and bows his head as if in prayer. He 
freezes in that position. The crowd begins to murmur, then 
scream . 



74. 



SCENE 88 DAY_EXT_ROME_CIRCUS 

The left gate opens and an enoi:mous Geiman bull runs out . It 
has a half naked girl tied to its back. With chapped lips, a 
pale Vinicius whispers 

VINICIUS 
God, I trust in you. 

He closes his eyes and mouths a silent prayer. 

Ursus sees Lygia hanging limply across the bull's back. He 
charges towards the bull and extends his hands. 

URSUS 

(savage war cry) Ruuaaaaah! 

The bull rears its powerful head, its horns ripping Ursus' s 
left side. Blood pours from the wound. 

URSUS 

(a warriors' shout of pain) 
Urraah ! 

Ursus falls to the ground as the crowd roars and the bull 
runs around the arena. 

CROWDS 

Get him! Get him! Kill the giant! 
Bleed him like a bull ! 

The injured Ursus struggles to get up. He sizes up the beast 
and then lunges at it, grabbing it by the horns. 

URSUS 

(warrior' s savage grunt and 
cry) Uuurrrrrrrah ! 

The bull starts shaking its head. 

Ursus tightens his muscles around the bull's neck. The 
animal pushes back. Ursus plants his feet in the ground, 
halting the beast's advance and they remain momentarily 
frozen. A murmur of admiration rises from the crowd. 

Ursus begins to twist the bulls head. Straining his muscles 
to their limit, he throws the beast to the ground. The 
animal's head, held in the giant's vise-like grip, begins to 
tilt downward. The beast lets out a roar as it begins to 
foam at the mouth. 



75. 



A moment later, Ursus twists the bull's head into an 
unnatural position. Roaring, it falls to the sand, kicking 
with its hooves. Ursus kneels over the fallen beast, takes 
hold of Lygia and lifts her up. The arena goes crazy. 

CROWDS 

Giant! Giant! Giant! Giant! 

Ursus holds her body up as he moves towards the imperial 
terrace . 

The air is filled with the sound of thousands of screaming 
spectators . Ursus kneels, holding up Lygia, extending her 
towards Caesar. 

CROWDS 

Giant! Giant! Giant! Giant! 



SCENE 89 DAY_EXT_ROME_CIRCUS 

Imperial terrace. Nero looks down, squinting. Clearly upset, 
he throws down his monocle. He looks around. The crowd 
chants. 

CROWD 

Mercy! Mercy! Mercy! Free them! 
Free them! Free them! Mercy! Mercy! 
Free them! Free them! Mercy! Mercy! 
Set them free! 

From all sides thumbs go up - a sign of mercy. The whole 
arena is a forest of raised thumbs. 

Nero does not want to accept their decision. He is furious. 
He looks to Poppea, Faon and the others for support. 
However, everyone is showing the thumbs up. Nero directs his 
gaze at Tigellinus. The pressure of the chanting crowd is 
enormous . 

CROWD 

Arsonist! Murderer! Tyrant! Mother 
Killer! Despot! Redbeard! Down with 
Caesar! Nero the murderous dog! 
Down with tyranny! 

Tigellinus gazes at the crowd. In the end, he too 
reluctantly raises his thvimb. Suddenly, the crowd once again 
starts shouting malevolently at Caesar. 

Nero still has yet to deliver his judgment . He keeps looking 
for at least one thumb turned down to support his decision. 



75. 



He looks at Petronius . They stare at each other for a while. 
First, second, third look. And suddenly Petronius raises his 
hand and then holding this position, without taking his eyes 
off Nero, he changes direction and shows a thumbs down. 

It is just as Petronius expected. Nero despises his former 
friend, seeing in him the antithesis of everything he hates 
in his own life. He cannot bear the thought of acting like 
Petronius . 

Caesar's thumb slowly drifts upwards. 

A look of relief passes over Petronius' s face. 



SCENE 90 DAY_INT_CIRCUS_DARK CORRIDOR TO THE STREET VIEW 

Ursus walks down the corridor leading from the arena towards 
the light coming into the Circus from the street . 

Vinicius stands in the sun's rays, on the other side of the 
bars. 

The guard opens the gates of the Circus and Ursus takes a 
step towards freedom. He gives Vinicius the body of the 
unconscious Lygia. 

Vinicius turns round, carrying his beloved away towards a 
new life, away from the Circus, away from Rome. 



SCENE 91 DAY_INT_ROME_PETRONIUS PALACE_LIBRARY + 
EXT_ROME_PANORAMA 

The morning light penetrates to the library. Petronius leans 
on Eunice' s arm. They sit in the library, next to the 
window, overlooking the garden, huddled in a beam of 
sunlight, staring into the distance, motionless . 

The centurion Hasto stands at the door behind them. Even he 
does not want to disturb this peace and waits a moment 
before speaking up. 

HASTO 

On Caesar's orders, Petronius, I 
bring you death sentence. 

The camera zooms out from the centurion's face and continues 
as Petronius and Eunice enter the frame, leaning against 
each other, their heads touching. 

When we finally see their faces, they are frozen in a smile, 
but devoid of life. Their eyes are closed. 



77. 



Off screen can be heard a whispered conversation, but the 
camera still continues to move backwards. In addition, going 
upwards - slowly like a balloon, like a soul escaping the 
body. 

PETRONIUS (OFF) 
Do you think Vinicius and Lygia 
have reached Sicily by now? 

EUNICE (OFF) 
Oh, yes. Surely. They were carried 
on the wings of love. 

PETRONIUS (OFF) 
It's time we also took a journey. 

EUNICE (OFF) 
Finally, Master, I'll have you at 
my side, forever. 

PETRONIUS (OFF) 
It's a pity you do not wish to 
stay. In my testament I left you 
all my property. 

EUNICE (OFF) 
Where we are going now, we won't 
lack anything! 

The camera goes on, floating, leaving the bodies of the 
people below and flows over the Petronius Palace gardens. 

Suddenly, there is a white pigeon taking flight . The camera 
follows him. 



SCENE 92 EXT_ROME_PANORAMA 

The camera continues to float, following the pigeon. 

Camera soared for bird so high that suddenly found itself 
among the clouds. Dairy light completely overlighted the 
view. 

When the camera broke through the clouds, you can see the 
landscape, which is filled to the horizon with a waterline, 
or mirrors, or clouds. 

How aviator loses the consciousness of his position, so we 
do not know at first that we see only a reflection of a 
bird. 

The camera follows the pigeon as in a dream, farther and 
farther. 



18. 



After a moment, the prospect of full of light, glare and 
seductive color shows its unreal, heavenly meaning. 

PAUL (OFF) 
If I speak in the tongues of men or 
of angels, but do not have love, I 
am only a resounding gong or a 
clanging cymbal. If I have the gift 
of prophecy and can fathom all 
mysteries and all knowledge, and if 
I have a faith that can move 
mountains, but do not have love, I 
am nothing . If I give all I possess 
to the poor and give over my body 
to hardship that I may boast, but do 
not have love, I gain nothing. 

Love is patient, love is kind. It 
does not envy, it does not boast, 
it is not proud. It does not 
dishonor others, it is not 
self-seeking, it is not easily 
angered, it keeps no record of 
wrongs. Love does not delight in 
evil but rejoices with the truth. 
It always protects, always trusts, 
always hopes, always perseveres. 
Thus faith, hope and love — these 
three endure: but the greatest of 
these is love.

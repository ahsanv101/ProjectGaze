"BLACK BART"

FADE IN:
EXT. PRAIRIE DAY

Panoramic shot of western prairie. In the far distance WE
SEE a speck of activity on the horizon.

CREDITS BEGIN:

Over credits we HEAR our title song, THE LOVE THEME FROM
BLACK BART, Title on screen reads:

THE LOVE THEME FROM BLACK BART SUNG BY MEL
BROOKS AS TONY BENNETT AND FRANKIE LAINE

We HEAR the faint SOUNDS of clanking and voices. As CAMERA
GETS CLOSER we begin to make out shapes of men hard at work.
CAMERA CONTINUES TO MOVE IN.

Through the heat shimmer we are now able to distinguish that
this is a railroad work gang made up of Blacks, Chinese and
Irish immigrant laborers. They are hard at work laying
track westward, under the watchful gaze of cruel overseers.

CREDITS END:
LYLE

the assistant foreman, walks into frame. He is obviously
dissatisfied. He is flanked by two cruel overseers. He
takes out a pocket watch, glances at it and puts it back.

LYLE:
C'mon boys. The way you're lolly-
gagging around here with them
shovels you'd think it was 120
degrees, Couldn't be more than
114. Ha, ha, ha.

A Chinese man falls over from the heat.

LYLE:
(continuing)

Dock that chink a day's pay for
napping on the job.

OVERSEER #1:
Right, Lyle.

LYLE:
Now c'mon boys, where's your spirit?
When you were slaves you sang like
birds. How about a good old nigger
work song.
2.

GANG OF BLACKS CUT TO:

They are sweating profusely, They look at each other. Our
hero, BLACK BART, shuffles forward. He is a handsome wiry
black man in his late 20's. His appearance suggests that
he is somewhat ahead of his time. He takes off his hat,
mops his brow in good old darkie fashion and then turns to
his fellow workers and nods. They hum a chord.

BART:
(segues into up-tempo,
Sinatra-style rendition of:)
"I GET NO KICK FROM CHAMPAGNE
MERE ALCOHOL DOESN'T THRILL ME AT ALL
S80 TELL ME WHY SHOULD IT RE TRUE
THAT I GET A KICK OUT OF YOU."

Bart's singing is beautifully backed up in Pied Piper
fashion by his co-workers.

CUT TO:
LYLE AND OVERSEERS
Looking at each other in amazement.
LYLE:
Hold it! Hold it! What the hell
is that shit! I meant a song.
Something like "Swing Low Sweet
Chariot". A song!
CUT TO:

BART
and his co-workers. They pretend to be puzzled.

CUT TO:

LYLE

LYLE:
Don't know that one, huh? Well,
how about "De Camptown Ladies".
Every darkie worth his soul knows
"De Camptown Ladies".

Bart turns to his co-workers in mock confusion.

MAN ON HORSEBACK APPROACHING CUT TO:

The man is TAGGART, the burly heartless, foreman. Taggart
rides over and strikes Lyle on the head with a swagger
stick.

TAGGART:
What in the wide, wide world of
sports is going on here? IT hired
you to get some track laid, not to
jump around like a bunch of Kansas
City faggots.

LYLE:
Sorry, Mr. Taggart...got caught up.

TAGGART:
Listen, shithead. Surveyor says there
might be some quicksand up ahead.

LYLE:
Okay, I'll send down a team of horses
to test the ground.

TAGGART:
(smashes him on head with
swagger stick)
Horses! Are you crazy? We can't afford
to lose horses. Send two niggras.

LYLE:
You and you.

Lyle points to Bart and CHARLIE, another black worker.

BART:
But, sir, he specifically asked for
two niggras. To tell a family secret,
my grandmother was Dutch. Are you
familiar with Holland? Well, you know
where Antwerp cuts off Rotterdam? Well,
right there we ran this little after hours
windmill...

LYLE:

Get on that handcar and take it down
to the end of the line.

Bart and Charlie walking to the handecar.

Hey Charlie, let me ask you something.
Now don't be too hasty with your answer.
Put some thought to it. What is it that's
not exactly water and it ain't exactly
earth and when it sucks you under it
squeezes the last shred of breath out
of your lungs till you die?

Bart and Charlie look at each other.

He turns around toward the direction of Bart and Charlie.

TAGGART

...to Rock Ridge.

Holy cow! Hurry, Lyle, get a rope.

Lyle gets rope from saddle - twirls loop over his head

this fancy twirling)

Hey, Lyle, can you still do that
fancy thing with the rope?

TAGGART:
Hurry up. There's $400 worth of
handcar sinking there.
CUT TO:

BART AND CHARLIE

BART:
Handcar! Hey you stupid sonova-
bitch, what about us?

Taggart walks over to edge of quicksand where Bart is
straining to reach an overhanging branch, Taggart
places his boot heel on Bart's forehead.

TAGGART:
Now that's the kind of attitude that
holds you people back. Maybe if you
had a little respect for your betters
you could make your way up in this
world.

CHARLIE:
Up. That's what we want - up!

TAGGART:

Lyle.

Taggart walks away. In a last desperate effort, Bart manages
to grab on to the handcar. Charlie grabs Bart's legs and the
two are pulled out together with the handcar, They lie there
trying to catch their breath.

TAGGART:
(to the exhausted
Bart and Charlie)
Okay boys, the break is over. Let's
not lie around taking sun baths.
Won't do you much good anyway.

Taggart and Lyle are convulsed by Taggart's dry wit.

TAGGART:
(continuing)
Here, put this shovel to some good
use.

He drops shovel on the ground next to Bart and walks back
toward Lyle. Bart grabs shovel, stands up and takes vicious
practice swings with it. Charlie looks at Bart.

CHARLIE:
Don't do it baby.

BART:
I have to!

Bart starts walking toward Taggart and Lyle.

TAGGART AND LYLE

TAGGART:
We're in a heap of trouble and
we're going to need a lot of extra

frontier gibberish.,.but it expressed a
courage that is little seen in this day

Our fathers came across the prairie,

The Governor is playing a little ukulele as he sere-

Oh, here it is, sir. It was under
